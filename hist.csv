1,371,The story of our world is a story that is still very imperfectly
1,372,known. A couple of hundred years ago men possessed the history of
1,373,little more than the last three thousand years.  What happened
1,374,before that time was a matter of legend and speculation.  Over a
1,375,large part of the civilized world it was believed and taught that
1,376,"the world had been created suddenly in 4004 B.C., though"
1,377,authorities differed as to whether this had occurred in the spring
1,378,or autumn of that year. This fantastically precise misconception
1,379,"was based upon a too literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible,"
1,380,and upon rather arbitrary theological assumptions connected
1,381,therewith.  Such ideas have long since been abandoned by religious
1,382,"teachers, and it is universally recognized that the universe in"
1,383,which we live has to all appearances existed for an enormous
1,384,period of time and possibly for endless time.  Of course there may
1,385,"be deception in these appearances, as a room may be made to seem"
1,386,endless by putting mirrors facing each other at either end.  But
1,387,that the universe in which we live has existed only for six or
1,388,seven thousand years may be regarded as an altogether exploded
1,389,idea.
1,391,"The earth, as everybody knows nowadays, is a spheroid, a sphere"
1,392,"slightly compressed, orange fashion, with a diameter of nearly"
1,393,"8,000 miles.  Its spherical shape has been known at least to a"
1,394,"limited number of intelligent people for nearly 2,500 years, but"
1,395,"before that time it was supposed to be flat, and various ideas"
1,396,which now seem fantastic were entertained about its relations to
1,397,the sky and the stars and planets.  We know now that it rotates
1,398,upon its {2} axis (which is about 24 miles shorter than its
1,399,"equatorial diameter) every twenty-four hours, and that this is the"
1,400,"cause of the alternations of day and night, that it circles about"
1,401,the sun in a slightly distorted and slowly variable oval path in a
1,402,year. Its distance from the sun varies between ninety-one and a
1,403,half millions at its nearest and ninety-four and a half million
1,404,miles.
1,408,"About the earth circles a smaller sphere, the moon, at an average"
1,409,"distance of 239,000 miles. Earth and moon are not the only bodies"
1,410,"to travel round the sun.  There are also the planets, Mercury and"
1,411,"Venus, at distances of thirty-six and sixty-seven millions of"
1,412,miles; and beyond the circle of the earth and disregarding a belt
1,413,"of numerous smaller bodies, the planetoids, there are Mars,"
1,414,"Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune at mean distances of 141, 483,"
1,415,"886, 1,782, and 1,793 millions of miles respectively.  These"
1,416,figures in {3} millions of miles are very difficult for the mind
1,417,to grasp.  It may help the reader's imagination if we reduce the
1,418,"sun and planets to a smaller, more conceivable scale."
1,422,"If, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch"
1,423,"diameter, the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323"
1,424,"yards away, that is about a fifth of a mile, four or five minutes'"
1,425,walking.  The moon would be a small pea two feet and a half from
1,426,the world.  Between earth and sun there would be the two inner
1,427,"planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of one hundred and"
1,428,twenty-five and two hundred and fifty yards from the sun. All
1,429,round and about these bodies there would be emptiness until you
1,430,"came to Mars, a hundred and seventy-five feet beyond the earth;"
1,431,"Jupiter {4} nearly a mile away, a foot in diameter; Saturn, a"
1,432,"little smaller, two miles off; Uranus four miles off and Neptune"
1,433,six miles off.  Then nothingness and nothingness except for small
1,434,particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapour for thousands
1,435,"of miles. The nearest star to earth on this scale would be 40,000"
1,436,miles away.
1,438,These figures will serve perhaps to give one some conception of
1,439,the immense emptiness of space in which the drama of life goes on.
1,441,For in all this enormous vacancy of space we know certainly of
1,442,life only upon the surface of our earth. It does not penetrate
1,443,"much more than three miles down into the 4,000 miles that separate"
1,444,"us from the centre of our globe, and it does not reach more than"
1,445,five miles above its surface.  Apparently all the limitlessness of
1,446,space is otherwise empty and dead.
1,448,The deepest ocean dredgings go down to five miles. The highest
1,449,recorded flight of an aeroplane is little more than four miles.
1,450,"Men have reached to seven miles up in balloons, but at a cost of"
1,451,"great suffering.  No bird can fly so high as five miles, and small"
1,452,birds and insects which have been carried up by aeroplanes drop
1,453,off insensible far below that level.
2,465,In the last fifty years there has been much very fine and
2,466,interesting speculation on the part of scientific men upon the age
2,467,and origin of our earth.  Here we cannot pretend to give even a
2,468,summary of such speculations because they involve the most subtle
2,469,mathematical and physical considerations.  The truth is that the
2,470,physical and astronomical sciences are still too undeveloped as
2,471,yet to make anything of the sort more than an illustrative
2,472,guesswork.  The general tendency has been to make the estimated
2,473,age of our globe longer and longer.  It now seems probable that
2,474,the earth has had an independent existence as a spinning planet
2,475,flying round and round the sun for a longer period than
2,476,"2,000,000,000 years.  It may have been much longer than that. This"
2,477,is a length of time that absolutely overpowers the imagination.
2,479,"Before that vast period of separate existence, the sun and earth"
2,480,and the other planets that circulate round the sun may have been a
2,481,great swirl of diffused matter in space.  The telescope reveals to
2,482,us in various parts of the heavens luminous spiral clouds of
2,483,"matter, the spiral nebulae, which appear to be in rotation about a"
2,484,centre.  It is supposed by many astronomers that the sun and its
2,485,"planets were once such a spiral, and that their matter has"
2,486,undergone concentration into its present form. Through majestic
2,487,aeons that concentration went on until in that vast remoteness of
2,488,"the past for which we have given figures, the world and its moon"
2,489,were distinguishable.  They were spinning then much faster than
2,490,they are spinning now; they were at a lesser distance from the
2,491,"sun; they travelled round it very much faster, and they were"
2,492,probably incandescent or molten at the surface.  The sun itself
2,493,was a much greater blaze in the heavens.
2,499,If we could go back through that infinitude of time and see the
2,500,"earth in this earlier stage of its history, we should behold a"
2,501,scene more like the interior of a blast furnace or the surface of
2,502,a lava flow before it cools and cakes over than any other
2,503,contemporary scene.  No water would be visible because all the
2,504,water there was would still be superheated steam in a stormy
2,505,atmosphere of sulphurous and metallic vapours.  Beneath this would
2,506,swirl and boil an ocean of molten rock substance.  Across a sky of
2,507,fiery clouds the glare of the hurrying sun and moon would sweep
2,508,swiftly like hot breaths of flame.
2,518,"Slowly by degrees as one million of years followed another, this"
2,519,{8} fiery scene would lose its eruptive incandescence.  The
2,520,vapours in the sky would rain down and become less dense overhead;
2,521,great slaggy cakes of solidifying rock would appear upon the
2,522,"surface of the molten sea, and sink under it, to be replaced by"
2,523,other floating masses.  The sun and moon growing now each more
2,524,"distant and each smaller, would rush with diminishing swiftness"
2,525,"across the heavens. The moon now, because of its smaller size,"
2,526,"would be already cooled far below incandescence, and would be"
2,527,alternately obstructing and reflecting the sunlight in a series of
2,528,eclipses and full moons.
2,532,"And so with a tremendous slowness through the vastness of time,"
2,533,the earth would grow more and more like the earth on which we
2,534,"live, until at last an age would come when, in the cooling air,"
2,535,"steam would begin to condense into clouds, and the first rain"
2,536,would fall hissing upon the first rocks below.  For endless
2,537,millenia the greater part of the earth's water would still be
2,538,"vaporized in the atmosphere, but there would now be hot streams"
2,539,running over the crystallizing {9} rocks below and pools and lakes
2,540,into which these streams would be carrying detritus and depositing
2,541,sediment.
2,545,At last a condition of things must have been attained in which a
2,546,man might have stood up on earth and looked about him and lived.
2,547,If we could have visited the earth at that time we should have
2,548,stood on great lava-like masses of rock without a trace of soil or
2,549,"touch of living vegetation, under a storm-rent sky.  Hot and"
2,550,"violent winds, exceeding the fiercest tornado that ever blows, and"
2,551,"downpours of rain such as our milder, slower earth to-day knows"
2,552,"nothing of, might have assailed us.  The water of the downpour"
2,553,"would have rushed by us, muddy with the spoils of the rocks,"
2,554,"coming together into torrents, cutting deep gorges and canyons as"
2,555,they hurried past to deposit their sediment in the earliest seas.
2,556,Through the clouds we should have glimpsed a great sun moving
2,557,"visibly across the sky, and in its wake and in the wake of the"
2,558,moon would have come a diurnal tide of earthquake and upheaval.
2,559,"And {10} the moon, which nowadays keeps one constant face to"
2,560,"earth, would then have been rotating visibly and showing the side"
2,561,it now hides so inexorably.
2,563,"The earth aged.  One million years followed another, and the day"
2,564,"lengthened, the sun grew more distant and milder, the moon's pace"
2,565,in the sky slackened; the intensity of rain and storm diminished
2,566,and the water in the first seas increased and ran together into
2,567,the ocean garment our planet henceforth wore.
2,569,But there was no life as yet upon the earth; the seas were
2,570,"lifeless, and the rocks were barren."
3,582,"As everybody knows nowadays, the knowledge we possess of life"
3,583,before the beginnings of human memory and tradition is derived
3,584,from the markings and fossils of living things in the stratified
3,585,"rocks. We find preserved in shale and slate, limestone, and"
3,586,"sandstone, bones, shells, fibres, stems, fruits, footmarks,"
3,587,"scratchings and the like, side by side with the ripple marks of"
3,588,the earliest tides and the pittings of the earliest rain-falls. It
3,589,is by the sedulous examination of this Record of the Rocks that
3,590,the past history of the earth's life has been pieced together.
3,591,That much nearly everybody knows to-day.  The sedimentary rocks do
3,592,"not lie neatly stratum above stratum; they have been crumpled,"
3,593,"bent, thrust about, distorted and mixed together like the leaves"
3,594,"of a library that has been repeatedly looted and burnt, and it is"
3,595,only as a result of many devoted lifetimes of work that the record
3,596,has been put into order and read.  The whole compass of time
3,597,represented by the record of the rocks is now estimated as
3,598,"1,600,000,000 years."
3,600,The earliest rocks in the record are called by geologists the
3,601,"Azoic rocks, because they show no traces of life.  Great areas of"
3,602,"these Azoic rocks lie uncovered in North America, and they are of"
3,603,such a thickness that geologists consider that they represent a
3,604,"period of at least half of the 1,600,000,000 which they assign to"
3,605,the whole geological record.  Let me repeat this profoundly
3,606,significant fact.  Half the great interval of time since land and
3,607,sea were first distinguishable on earth has left us no traces of
3,608,life.  There are ripplings and rain marks still to be found in
3,609,"these rocks, but no marks nor vestiges of any living thing."
3,619,"Then, as we come up the record, signs of past life appear and"
3,620,increase.  The age of the world's history in which we find these
3,621,past {13} traces is called by geologists the Lower Palaeozoic age.
3,622,The first indications that life was astir are vestiges of
3,623,comparatively simple and lowly things: the shells of small
3,624,"shellfish, the stems and flowerlike heads of zoophytes, seaweeds"
3,625,and the tracks and remains of sea worms and crustacea.  Very early
3,626,"appear certain creatures rather like plant-lice, crawling"
3,627,creatures which could roll themselves up into balls as the
3,628,"plant-lice do, the trilobites.  Later by a few million years or so"
3,629,"come certain sea scorpions, more mobile and powerful creatures"
3,630,than the world had ever seen before.
3,634,None of these creatures were of very great size.  Among the
3,635,"largest were certain of the sea scorpions, which measured nine"
3,636,feet in length.  There are no signs whatever of land life of any
3,637,"sort, plant or animal; there are no fishes nor any vertebrated"
3,638,creatures in this part of the record.  Essentially all the plants
3,639,and creatures which have left us their traces from this period of
3,640,the earth's history are shallow-water and intertidal beings.  If
3,641,we wished to parallel the flora and fauna of the Lower Palaeozoic
3,642,"rocks on the earth to-day, we should do it best, except in the"
3,643,"matter of size, by taking a drop of water from a rock pool or"
3,644,scummy ditch and examining it under a microscope.  The little
3,645,"crustacea, the small shellfish, the zoophytes and algae we should"
3,646,find there would display a quite striking resemblance to these
3,647,"clumsier, larger prototypes that once were the crown of life upon"
3,648,our planet.
3,653,"It is well, however, to bear in mind that the Lower Palaeozoic"
3,654,rocks probably do not give us anything at all representative of
3,655,the first beginnings of life on our planet. Unless a creature has
3,656,"bones {14} or other hard parts, unless it wears a shell or is big"
3,657,enough and heavy enough to make characteristic footprints and
3,658,"trails in mud, it is unlikely to leave any fossilized traces of"
3,659,its existence behind.  To-day there are hundreds of thousands of
3,660,species of small soft-bodied creatures in our world which it is
3,661,inconceivable can ever leave any mark for future geologists to
3,662,"discover.  In the world's past, millions of millions of species of"
3,663,such creatures may have lived and multiplied and flourished and
3,664,passed away without a trace remaining.  The waters of the warm and
3,665,shallow lakes and seas of the so-called Azoic period may have
3,666,"teemed with an infinite variety {15} of lowly, jelly-like,"
3,667,"shell-less and boneless creatures, and a multitude of green scummy"
3,668,plants may have spread over the sunlit intertidal rocks and
3,669,beaches.  The Record of the Rocks is no more a complete record of
3,670,life in the past than the books of a bank are a record of the
3,671,existence of everybody in the neighbourhood.  It is only when a
3,672,species begins to secrete a shell or a spicule or a carapace or a
3,673,"lime-supported stem, and so put by something for the future, that"
3,674,it goes upon the Record.  But in rocks of an age prior to those
3,675,"which bear any fossil traces, graphite, a form of uncombined"
3,676,"carbon, is sometimes found, and some authorities consider that it"
3,677,may have been separated out from combination through the vital
3,678,activities of unknown living things.
4,693,In the days when the world was supposed to have endured for only a
4,694,"few thousand years, it was supposed that the different species of"
4,695,plants and animals were fixed and final; they had all been created
4,696,"exactly as they are to-day, each species by itself.  But as men"
4,697,began to discover and study the Record of the Rocks this belief
4,698,gave place to the suspicion that many species had changed and
4,699,"developed slowly through the course of ages, and this again"
4,700,"expanded into a belief in what is called Organic Evolution, a"
4,701,"belief that all species of life upon earth, animal and vegetable"
4,702,"alike, are descended by slow continuous processes of change from"
4,703,"some very simple ancestral form of life, some almost structureless"
4,704,"living substance, far back in the so-called Azoic seas."
4,706,"This question of Organic Evolution, like the question of the age"
4,707,"of the earth, has in the past been the subject of much bitter"
4,708,controversy.  There was a time when a belief in organic evolution
4,709,was for rather obscure reasons supposed to be incompatible with
4,710,"sound Christian, Jewish and Moslem doctrine.  That time has"
4,711,"passed, and the men of the most orthodox Catholic, Protestant,"
4,712,Jewish and Mohammedan belief are now free to accept this newer and
4,713,broader view of a common origin of all living things.  No life
4,714,seems to have happened suddenly upon earth.  Life grew and grows.
4,715,"Age by age through gulfs of time at which imagination reels, life"
4,716,has been growing from a mere stirring in the intertidal slime
4,717,"towards freedom, power and consciousness."
4,719,Life consists of individuals. These individuals are definite
4,720,"things, they are not like the lumps and masses, nor even the"
4,721,"limitless and motionless crystals, of non-living matter, and they"
4,722,have two characteristics no dead matter possesses.  They can
4,723,assimilate other matter into themselves and make it part of
4,724,"themselves, and {17} they can reproduce themselves.  They eat and"
4,725,"they breed.  They can give rise to other individuals, for the most"
4,726,"part like themselves, but always also a little different from"
4,727,themselves.  There is a specific and family resemblance between an
4,728,"individual and its offspring, and there is an individual"
4,729,"difference between every parent and every offspring it produces,"
4,730,and this is true in every species and at every stage of life.
4,735,Now scientific men are not able to explain to us either why
4,736,offspring should resemble nor why they should differ from their
4,737,parents.  But seeing that offspring do at once resemble and
4,738,"differ, it is a matter rather of common sense than of scientific"
4,739,"knowledge that, if the conditions under which a species live are"
4,740,"changed, the species should undergo some correlated changes."
4,741,Because in any generation of the species there must be a number of
4,742,individuals whose individual differences make them better adapted
4,743,"to the new conditions under which the species has to live, and a"
4,744,number whose individuals whose individual differences make it
4,745,rather harder for them to live.  And on the whole the former sort
4,746,"will live longer, bear more offspring, and reproduce themselves"
4,747,"more abundantly than the latter, and so generation by generation"
4,748,the average of the species will change in the favourable
4,749,"direction.  This process, which is called Natural Selection, is"
4,750,not so much a scientific theory as a necessary deduction {18} from
4,751,the facts of reproduction and individual difference.  There may be
4,752,"many forces at work varying, destroying and preserving species,"
4,753,"about which science may still be unaware or undecided, but the man"
4,754,who can deny the operation of this process of natural selection
4,755,upon life since its beginning must be either ignorant of the
4,756,elementary facts of life or incapable of ordinary thought.
4,758,Many scientific men have speculated about the first beginning of
4,759,"life and their speculations are often of great interest, but there"
4,760,is absolutely no definite knowledge and no convincing guess yet of
4,761,the way in which life began.  But nearly all authorities are
4,762,agreed that it probably began upon mud or sand in warm sunlit
4,763,"shallow brackish water, and that it spread up the beaches to the"
4,764,intertidal lines and out to the open waters.
4,768,That early world was a world of strong tides and currents.  An
4,769,incessant destruction of individuals must have been going on
4,770,"through their being swept up the beaches and dried, or by their"
4,771,being swept out to sea and sinking down out of reach of air and
4,772,sun.  Early conditions favoured the development of every tendency
4,773,"to root and hold on, every tendency to form an outer skin and"
4,774,casing to protect the stranded individual from immediate
4,775,desiccation.  From the very earliest any tendency to sensitiveness
4,776,"to taste would turn the individual in the direction of food, and"
4,777,any sensitiveness to light would assist it to struggle back out of
4,778,the darkness of the sea deeps and caverns or to wriggle back out
4,779,of the excessive glare of the dangerous shallows.
4,781,Probably the first shells and body armour of living things were
4,782,protections against drying rather than against active enemies.
4,783,But tooth and claw come early into our earthly history.
4,785,We have already noted the size of the earlier water scorpions.
4,786,For long ages such creatures were the supreme lords of life. Then
4,787,{19} in a division of these Palaeozoic rocks called the Silurian
4,788,"division, which many geologists now suppose to be as old as five"
4,789,"hundred million years, there appears a new type of being, equipped"
4,790,with eyes and teeth and swimming powers of an altogether more
4,791,"powerful kind.  These were the first known backboned animals, the"
4,792,"earliest fishes, the first known Vertebrata."
4,796,"These fishes increase greatly in the next division of rocks, the"
4,797,rocks known as the Devonian system.  They are so prevalent that
4,798,this period of the Record of the Rocks has been called the Age of
4,799,"{20} Fishes.  Fishes of a pattern now gone from the earth, and"
4,800,"fishes allied to the sharks and sturgeons of to-day, rushed"
4,801,"through the waters, leapt in the air, browsed among the seaweeds,"
4,802,"pursued and preyed upon one another, and gave a new liveliness to"
4,803,the waters of the world.  None of these were excessively big by
4,804,our present standards.  Few of them were more than two or three
4,805,"feet long, but there were exceptional forms which were as long as"
4,806,twenty feet.
4,808,We know nothing from geology of the ancestors of these fishes.
4,809,They do not appear to be related to any of the forms that preceded
4,810,them.  Zoologists have the most interesting views of their
4,811,"ancestry, but these they derive from the study of the development"
4,812,"of the eggs of their still living relations, and from other"
4,813,sources.  Apparently the ancestors of the vertebrata were
4,814,soft-bodied and perhaps quite small swimming creatures who began first
4,815,to develop hard parts as teeth round and about their mouths.  The
4,816,teeth of a skate or dogfish cover the roof and floor of its mouth
4,817,and pass at the lip into the flattened toothlike scales that
4,818,encase most of its body.  As the fishes develop these teeth scales
4,819,"in the geological record, they swim out of the hidden darkness of"
4,820,"the past into the light, the first vertebrated animals visible in"
4,821,the record.
5,833,The land during this Age of Fishes was apparently quite lifeless.
5,834,Crags and uplands of barren rock lay under the sun and rain.
5,835,There was no real soil--for as yet there were no earthworms which
5,836,"help to make a soil, and no plants to break up the rock particles"
5,837,into mould; there was no trace of moss or lichen.  Life was still
5,838,only in the sea.
5,840,Over this world of barren rock played great changes of climate.
5,841,The causes of these changes of climate were very complex and they
5,842,have still to be properly estimated.  The changing shape of the
5,843,"earth's orbit, the gradual shifting of the poles of rotation,"
5,844,"changes in the shapes of the continents, probably even"
5,845,"fluctuations in the warmth of the sun, now conspired to plunge"
5,846,great areas of the earth's surface into long periods of cold and
5,847,ice and now again for millions of years spread a warm or equable
5,848,climate over this planet.  There seem to have been phases of great
5,849,"internal activity in the world's history, when in the course of a"
5,850,few million years accumulated upthrusts would break out in lines
5,851,of volcanic eruption and upheaval and rearrange the mountain and
5,852,"continental outlines of the globe, increasing the depth of the sea"
5,853,and the height of the mountains and exaggerating the extremes of
5,854,climate.  And these would be followed by vast ages of comparative
5,855,"quiescence, when frost, rain and river would wear down the"
5,856,mountain heights and carry great masses of silt to fill and raise
5,857,"the sea bottoms and spread the seas, ever shallower and wider,"
5,858,"over more and more of the land.  There have been ""high and deep"""
5,859,"ages in the world's history and ""low and level"" ages.  The reader"
5,860,must dismiss from his mind any idea that the surface of the earth
5,861,has been growing steadily cooler since its crust grew solid.
5,862,"After that much cooling had been achieved, the internal"
5,863,temperature ceased to affect surface {22} conditions. There are
5,864,"traces of periods of superabundant ice and snow, of ""Glacial"
5,865,"Ages,"" that is, even in the Azoic period."
5,867,"It was only towards the close of the Age of Fishes, in a period of"
5,868,"extensive shallow seas and lagoons, that life spread itself out in"
5,869,any effectual way from the waters on to the land.  No doubt the
5,870,earlier types of the forms that now begin to appear in great
5,871,abundance had already been developing in a rare and obscure manner
5,872,for many scores of millions of years.  But now came their
5,873,opportunity.
5,877,Plants no doubt preceded animal forms in this invasion of the
5,878,"land, but the animals probably followed up the plant emigration"
5,879,{23} very closely.  The first problem that the plant had to solve
5,880,was the problem of some sustaining stiff support to hold up its
5,881,fronds to the sunlight when the buoyant water was withdrawn; the
5,882,second was the problem of getting water from the swampy ground
5,883,"below to the tissues of the plant, now that it was no longer close"
5,884,at hand.  The two problems were solved by the development of woody
5,885,tissue which both sustained the plant and acted as water carrier
5,886,to the leaves.  The Record of the Rocks is suddenly crowded by a
5,887,"vast variety of woody swamp plants, many of them of great size,"
5,888,"big tree mosses, tree ferns, gigantic horsetails and the like."
5,889,"And with these, age by age, there crawled out of the water a great"
5,890,variety of animal forms.  There were centipedes and millipedes;
5,891,there were the first primitive insects; there were creatures
5,892,related to the ancient king crabs and sea scorpions which became
5,893,"the earliest spiders and land scorpions, and presently there were"
5,894,vertebrated animals.
5,898,Some of the earlier insects were very large. There were dragon
5,899,flies in this period with wings that spread out to twenty-nine
5,900,inches.
5,902,In various ways these new orders and genera had adapted themselves
5,903,to breathing air.  Hitherto all animals had breathed air dissolved
5,904,"in water, and that indeed is what all animals still have to do."
5,905,But now in divers fashions the animal kingdom was acquiring the
5,906,power of supplying its own moisture where it was needed.  A man
5,907,with a perfectly dry lung would suffocate to-day; {24} his lung
5,908,surfaces must be moist in order that air may pass through them
5,909,into his blood.  The adaptation to air breathing consists in all
5,910,cases either in the development of a cover to the old-fashioned
5,911,"gills to stop evaporation, or in the development of tubes or other"
5,912,new breathing organs lying deep inside the body and moistened by a
5,913,watery secretion.  The old gills with which the ancestral fish of
5,914,the vertebrated line had breathed were inadaptable to breathing
5,915,"upon land, and in the case of this division of the animal kingdom"
5,916,"it is the swimming bladder of the fish which becomes a new,"
5,917,"deep-seated breathing organ, the lung.  The kind of animals"
5,918,"known as amphibia, the frogs and newts of to-day, begin"
5,919,their lives in the water and breathe by gills; and subsequently
5,920,"the lung, developing in the same way as the swimming"
5,921,"bladder of many fishes do, as a baglike outgrowth from the throat,"
5,922,"takes over the business of breathing, the animal comes out on"
5,923,"land, and the gills dwindle and the gill slits disappear.  (All"
5,924,"except an outgrowth of one gill slit, which becomes the passage of"
5,925,"the ear and ear-drum.)  The animal can now live only in the air,"
5,926,but it must return at least to the edge of the water to lay its
5,927,eggs and reproduce its kind.
5,931,All the air-breathing vertebrata of this age of swamps and plants
5,932,belonged to the class amphibia.  They were nearly all of them
5,933,"forms related to the newts of to-day, and some of them attained a"
5,934,"considerable size.  They were land animals, it is true, but they"
5,935,were land animals needing to live in and near moist and swampy
5,936,"places, and all the great trees of this period were equally {25}"
5,937,amphibious in their habits.  None of them had yet developed fruits
5,938,and seeds of a kind that could fall on land and develop with the
5,939,help only of such moisture as dew and rain could bring.  They all
5,940,"had to shed their spores in water, it would seem, if they were to"
5,941,germinate.
5,943,It is one of the most beautiful interests of that beautiful
5,944,"science, comparative anatomy, to trace the complex and wonderful"
5,945,adaptations of living things to the necessities of existence in
5,946,"air.  All living things, plants and animals alike, are primarily"
5,947,water things.  For example all the higher vertebrated animals
5,948,"above the fishes, up to and including man, pass through a stage in"
5,949,their development in the egg or before birth in which they have
5,950,gill slits which are obliterated before the young emerge.  The
5,951,"bare, water-washed eye of the fish is protected in the higher"
5,952,forms from drying up by eyelids and glands which secrete moisture.
5,953,The weaker sound vibrations of air necessitate an ear-drum.  In
5,954,nearly every organ of the body similar modifications and
5,955,"adaptations are to be detected, similar patchings-up to meet"
5,956,aerial conditions.
5,958,"This Carboniferous age, this age of the amphibia, was an age of"
5,959,life in the swamps and lagoons and on the low banks among these
5,960,waters.  Thus far life had now extended.  The hills and high lands
5,961,were still quite barren and lifeless.  Life had learnt to breathe
5,962,"air indeed, but it still had its roots in its native water; it"
5,963,still had to return to the water to reproduce its kind.
6,975,The abundant life of the Carboniferous period was succeeded by a
6,976,vast cycle of dry and bitter ages.  They are represented in the
6,977,"Record of the Rocks by thick deposits of sandstones and the like,"
6,978,in which fossils are comparatively few.  The temperature of the
6,979,"world fluctuated widely, and there were long periods of glacial"
6,980,cold.  Over great areas the former profusion of swamp vegetation
6,981,"ceased, and, overlaid by these newer deposits, it began that"
6,982,process of compression and mineralization that gave the world most
6,983,of the coal deposits of to-day.
6,985,But it is during periods of change that life undergoes its most
6,986,"rapid modifications, and under hardship that it learns its hardest"
6,987,lessons.  As conditions revert towards warmth and moisture again
6,988,"we find a new series of animal and plant forms established,  We"
6,989,find in the record the remains of vertebrated animals that laid
6,990,"eggs which, instead of hatching out tadpoles which needed to live"
6,991,"for a time in water, carried on their development before hatching"
6,992,to a stage so nearly like the adult form that the young could live
6,993,in air from the first moment of independent existence.  Gills had
6,994,"been cut out altogether, and the gill slits only appeared as an"
6,995,embryonic phase.
6,997,These new creatures without a tadpole stage were the Reptiles.
6,998,"Concurrently there had been a development of seed-bearing trees,"
6,999,"which could spread their seed, independently of swamp or lakes."
6,1000,"There were now palmlike cycads and many tropical conifers, though"
6,1001,as yet there were no flowering plants and no grasses.  There was a
6,1002,great number of ferns.  And there was now also an increased
6,1003,"variety of insects.  There were beetles, though bees and"
6,1004,butterflies had yet to come.  But all the fundamental forms of a
6,1005,new real land fauna and flora had been laid down during these vast
6,1006,ages of severity.  {27} This new land life needed only the
6,1007,opportunity of favourable conditions to flourish and prevail.
6,1011,Age by age and with abundant fluctuations that mitigation came.
6,1012,"The still incalculable movements of the earth's crust, the changes"
6,1013,"in its orbit, the increase and diminution of the mutual"
6,1014,"inclination of orbit and pole, worked together to produce a great"
6,1015,spell of widely diffused warm conditions.  The period lasted
6,1016,"altogether, it is now supposed, upwards of two hundred million"
6,1017,"years.  It is called the Mesozoic period, to distinguish it from"
6,1018,the altogether vaster Palaeozoic and Azoic periods (together
6,1019,"fourteen hundred millions) that preceded it, and from the"
6,1020,Cainozoic or new life period that intervened between its close and
6,1021,"the present time, and it is also called the Age of Reptiles"
6,1022,because of the astonishing predominance and variety of this form
6,1023,of life.  It came to an end some eighty million  years ago.
6,1025,In the world to-day the genera of Reptiles are comparatively few
6,1026,"and their distribution is very limited.  They are more various, it"
6,1027,"is true, than are the few surviving members of the order of the"
6,1028,amphibia which once in the Carboniferous period ruled the world.
6,1029,"We still have the snakes, the turtles and tortoises (the"
6,1030,"Chelonia), {28} the alligators and crocodiles, and the lizards."
6,1031,Without exception they are creatures requiring warmth all the year
6,1032,"round; they cannot stand exposure to cold, and it is probable that"
6,1033,all the reptilian beings of the Mesozoic suffered under the same
6,1034,"limitation.  It was a hothouse fauna, living amidst a hothouse"
6,1035,flora.  It endured no frosts.  But the world had at least attained
6,1036,a real dry land fauna and flora as distinguished from the mud and
6,1037,swamp fauna and flora of the previous heyday of life upon earth.
6,1041,All the sorts of reptile we know now were much more abundantly
6,1042,"represented then, great turtles and tortoises, big crocodiles and"
6,1043,"many lizards and snakes, but in addition there was a number of"
6,1044,series of wonderful creatures that have now vanished altogether
6,1045,from the earth.  There was a vast variety of beings called the
6,1046,Dinosaurs.  Vegetation was now spreading over the lower levels of
6,1047,"the world, reeds, brakes of fern and the like; and browsing upon"
6,1048,"this abundance came a multitude of herbivorous reptiles, which"
6,1049,increased in size as the Mesozoic period rose to its climax.  Some
6,1050,of these beasts exceeded in size any other land animals that have
6,1051,ever lived; they were as large as whales.  The _Diplodocus
6,1052,Carnegii_ for example measured eighty-four feet from snout to
6,1053,tail; the Gigantosaurus was even greater; it measured a hundred
6,1054,feet.  Living upon these monsters was a swarm of carnivorous
6,1055,"Dinosaurs of a corresponding size.  One of these, the"
6,1056,"Tyrannosaurus, is figured and described in many books as the last"
6,1057,word in reptilian frightfulness.
6,1064,While these great creatures pastured and pursued amidst the fronds
6,1065,"and evergreens of the Mesozoic jungles, another now vanished tribe"
6,1066,"of reptiles, with a bat-like development of the fore limbs,"
6,1067,"pursued insects and one another, first leapt and parachuted and"
6,1068,presently flew amidst the fronds and branches of the forest trees.
6,1069,These were the Pterodactyls. These were the first flying creatures
6,1070,with backbones; they mark a new achievement in the growing powers
6,1071,of vertebrated life.
6,1073,Moreover some of the reptiles were returning to the sea waters.
6,1074,Three groups of big swimming beings had invaded the sea from which
6,1075,"their ancestors had come: the Mososaurs, the Plesiosaurs, and"
6,1076,Ichthyosaurs.  Some of these again approached the proportions of
6,1077,our present whales.  The Ichthyosaurs seem to have been quite
6,1078,"seagoing creatures, but the Plesiosaurs were a type of animal that"
6,1079,has no cognate form to-day.  The body was stout and big with
6,1080,"paddles, adapted either for swimming or crawling through marshes,"
6,1081,or along the bottom of shallow waters.  The comparatively small
6,1082,"{30} head was poised on a vast snake of neck, altogether outdoing"
6,1083,the neck of the swan.  Either the Plesiosaur swam and searched for
6,1084,"food under the water and fed as the swan will do, or it lurked"
6,1085,under water and snatched at passing fish or beast.
6,1087,Such was the predominant land life throughout the Mesozoic age.
6,1088,It was by our human standards an advance upon anything that had
6,1089,"preceded it.  It had produced land animals greater in size, range,"
6,1090,"power and activity, more ""vital"" as people say, than anything the"
6,1091,world had seen before.  In the seas there had been no such advance
6,1092,but a great proliferation of new forms of life.  An enormous
6,1093,"variety of squid-like creatures with chambered shells, for the"
6,1094,"most part coiled, had appeared in the shallow seas, the Ammonites."
6,1095,"They had had predecessors in the Palaeozoic seas, but now was their"
6,1096,age of glory.  To-day they have left no survivors at all; their
6,1097,"nearest relation is the pearly Nautilus, an inhabitant of tropical"
6,1098,"waters.  And a new and more prolific type of fish with lighter,"
6,1099,finer scales than the plate-like and tooth-like coverings that had
6,1100,"hitherto prevailed, became and has since remained predominant in"
6,1101,the seas and rivers.
7,1113,In a few paragraphs a picture of the lush vegetation and swarming
7,1114,"reptiles of that first great summer of life, the Mesozoic period,"
7,1115,has been sketched.  But while the Dinosaurs lorded it over the hot
7,1116,selvas and marshy plains and the Pterodactyls filled the forests
7,1117,with their flutterings and possibly with shrieks and croakings as
7,1118,they pursued the humming insect life of the still flowerless
7,1119,"shrubs and trees, some less conspicuous and less abundant forms"
7,1120,upon the margins of this abounding life were acquiring certain
7,1121,"powers and learning certain lessons of endurance, that were to be"
7,1122,of the utmost value to their race when at last the smiling
7,1123,generosity of sun and earth began to fade.
7,1125,"A group of tribes and genera of hopping reptiles, small creatures"
7,1126,"of the dinosaur type, seem to have been pushed by competition and"
7,1127,the pursuit of their enemies towards the alternatives of
7,1128,extinction or adaptation to colder conditions in the higher hills
7,1129,or by the sea.  Among these distressed tribes there was developed
7,1130,a new type of scale--scales that were elongated into quill-like
7,1131,forms and that presently branched into the crude beginnings of
7,1132,feathers.  These quill-like scales layover one another and formed
7,1133,a heat-retaining covering more efficient than any reptilian
7,1134,covering that had hitherto existed.  So they permitted an invasion
7,1135,of colder regions that were otherwise uninhabited.  Perhaps
7,1136,simultaneously with these changes there arose in these creatures a
7,1137,greater solicitude for their eggs.  Most reptiles are apparently
7,1138,"quite careless about their eggs, which are left for sun and season"
7,1139,to hatch.  But some of the varieties upon this new branch of the
7,1140,tree of life were acquiring a habit of guarding their eggs and
7,1141,keeping them warm with the warmth of their bodies.
7,1143,With these adaptations to cold other internal modifications {32}
7,1144,"were going on that made these creatures, the primitive birds,"
7,1145,warm-blooded and independent of basking.  The very earliest birds
7,1146,"seem to have been seabirds living upon fish, and their fore limbs"
7,1147,were not wings but paddles rather after the penguin type.  That
7,1148,"peculiarly primitive bird, the New Zealand Ki-Wi, has feathers of"
7,1149,"a very simple sort, and neither flies nor appears to be descended"
7,1150,"from flying ancestors.  In the development of the birds, feathers"
7,1151,came before wings.  But once the feather was developed the
7,1152,possibility of making a light spread of feathers led inevitably to
7,1153,the wing.  We know of the fossil remains of one bird at least
7,1154,"which had reptilian teeth in its jaw and a long reptilian tail,"
7,1155,but which also had a true bird's wing and which certainly flew and
7,1156,held its own among the pterodactyls of the Mesozoic time.
7,1157,Nevertheless birds were neither varied nor abundant in Mesozoic
7,1158,"times.  If a man could go back to typical Mesozoic country, he"
7,1159,"might walk for days and never see or hear such a thing as a bird,"
7,1160,though he would see a great abundance of pterodactyls and insects
7,1161,among the fronds and reeds.
7,1166,"And another thing he would probably never see, and that would be"
7,1167,any sign of a mammal.  Probably the first mammals were in {33}
7,1168,existence millions of years before the first thing one could call
7,1169,"a bird, but they were altogether too small and obscure and remote"
7,1170,for attention.
7,1174,"The earliest mammals, like the earliest birds, were creatures"
7,1175,driven by competition and pursuit into a life of hardship and
7,1176,"adaptation to cold.  With them also the scale became quill-like,"
7,1177,and was developed into a heat-retaining covering; and they too
7,1178,"underwent modifications, similar in kind though different in"
7,1179,"detail, to become warm-blooded and independent of basking."
7,1180,"Instead of feathers they developed hairs, and instead of guarding"
7,1181,and incubating their eggs they kept them warm and safe by
7,1182,retaining them inside their bodies until they were almost mature.
7,1183,Most of them became altogether vivaparous and brought their young
7,1184,into the world alive.  And even after their young were born they
7,1185,tended to maintain a protective and nutritive association with
7,1186,them.  Most {34} but not all mammals to-day have mammae and suckle
7,1187,their young.  Two mammals still live which lay eggs and which have
7,1188,"not proper mammae, though they nourish their young by a nutritive"
7,1189,secretion of the under skin; these are the duck-billed platypus
7,1190,and the echidna.  The echidna lays leathery eggs and then puts
7,1191,"them into a pouch under its belly, and so carries them about warm"
7,1192,and safe until they hatch.
7,1194,But just as a visitor to the Mesozoic world might have searched
7,1195,"for days and weeks before finding a bird, so, unless he knew"
7,1196,"exactly where to go and look, he might have searched in vain for"
7,1197,any traces of a mammal.  Both birds and mammals would have seemed
7,1198,very eccentric and secondary and unimportant creatures in Mesozoic
7,1199,times.
7,1211,"The Age of Reptiles lasted, it is now guessed, eighty million"
7,1212,years.  Had any quasi-human intelligence been watching the world
7,1213,"through that inconceivable length of time, how safe and eternal"
7,1214,"the sunshine and abundance must have seemed, how assured the"
7,1215,wallowing prosperity of the dinosaurs and the flapping abundance
7,1216,of the flying lizards!  And then the mysterious rhythms and
7,1217,accumulating forces of the universe began to turn against that
7,1218,quasi-eternal stability.  That run of luck {36} for life was
7,1219,"running out.  Age by age, myriad of years after myriad of years,"
7,1220,"with halts no doubt and retrogressions, came a change towards"
7,1221,"hardship and extreme conditions, came great alterations of level"
7,1222,and great redistributions of mountain and sea.  We find one thing
7,1223,in the Record of the Rocks during the decadence of the long
7,1224,Mesozoic age of prosperity that is very significant of steadily
7,1225,"sustained changes of condition, and that is a violent fluctuation"
7,1226,of living forms and the appearance of new and strange species.
7,1227,Under the gathering threat of extinction the older orders and
7,1228,genera are displaying their utmost capacity for variation and
7,1229,adaptation.  The Ammonites for example in these last pages of the
7,1230,Mesozoic chapter exhibit a multitude of fantastic forms.  Under
7,1231,settled conditions there is no encouragement for novelties; they
7,1232,"do not develop, they are suppressed; what is best adapted is"
7,1233,already there.  Under novel conditions it is the ordinary type
7,1234,"that suffers, and the novelty that may have a better chance to"
7,1235,survive and establish itself....
7,1237,There comes a break in the Record of the Rocks that may represent
7,1238,"several million years.  There is a veil here still, over even the"
7,1239,"outline of the history of life.  When it lifts again, the Age of"
7,1240,"Reptiles is at an end; the Dinosaurs, the Plesiosaurs and"
7,1241,"Ichthyosaurs, the Pterodactyls, the innumerable genera and species"
7,1242,of Ammonite have all gone absolutely.  In all their stupendous
7,1243,variety they have died out and left no descendants.  The cold has
7,1244,killed them.  All their final variations were insufficient; they
7,1245,had never hit upon survival conditions.  The world had passed
7,1246,through a phase of extreme conditions beyond their powers of
7,1247,"endurance, a slow and complete massacre of Mesozoic life has"
7,1248,"occurred, and we find now a new scene, a new and hardier flora,"
7,1249,and a new and hardier fauna in possession of the world.
7,1251,It is still a bleak and impoverished scene with which this new
7,1252,volume of the book of life begins. The cycads and tropical
7,1253,conifers have given place very largely to trees that shed their
7,1254,leaves to avoid destruction by the snows of winter and to
7,1255,"flowering plants and shrubs, and where there was formerly a"
7,1256,"profusion of reptiles, an increasing variety of birds and mammals"
7,1257,is entering into their inheritance.
8,1269,"The opening of the next great period in the life of the earth, the"
8,1270,"Cainozoic period, was a period of upheaval and extreme volcanic"
8,1271,activity.  Now it was that the vast masses of the Alps and
8,1272,Himalayas and the mountain backbone of the Rockies and Andes were
8,1273,"thrust up, and that the rude outlines of our present oceans and"
8,1274,continents appeared.  The map of the world begins to display a
8,1275,first dim resemblance to the map of to-day.  It is estimated now
8,1276,that between forty and eighty million years have elapsed from the
8,1277,beginnings of the Cainozoic period to the present time.
8,1279,At the outset of the Cainozoic period the climate of the world was
8,1280,austere.  It grew generally warmer until a fresh phase of great
8,1281,"abundance was reached, after which conditions grew hard again and"
8,1282,"the earth passed into a series of extremely cold cycles, the"
8,1283,"Glacial Ages, from which apparently it is now slowly emerging."
8,1285,But we do not know sufficient of the causes of climatic change at
8,1286,present to forecast the possible fluctuations of climatic
8,1287,conditions that lie before us.  We may be moving towards
8,1288,increasing sunshine or lapsing towards another glacial age;
8,1289,volcanic activity and the upheaval of mountain masses may be
8,1290,increasing or diminishing; we do not know; we lack sufficient
8,1291,science.
8,1293,With the opening of this period the grasses appear; for the first
8,1294,time there is pasture in the world; and with the full development
8,1295,"of the once obscure mammalian type, appear a number of interesting"
8,1296,grazing animals and of carnivorous types which prey upon these.
8,1298,At first these early mammals seem to differ only in a few
8,1299,characters from the great herbivorous and carnivorous reptiles
8,1300,that ages before had flourished and then vanished from the earth.
8,1301,A {38} careless observer might suppose that in this second long
8,1302,"age of warmth and plenty that was now beginning, nature was merely"
8,1303,"repeating the first, with herbivorous and carnivorous mammals to"
8,1304,"parallel the herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, with birds"
8,1305,replacing pterodactyls and so on.  But this would be an altogether
8,1306,superficial comparison.  The variety of the universe is infinite
8,1307,and incessant; it progresses eternally; history never repeats
8,1308,itself and no parallels are precisely true.  The differences
8,1309,between the life of the Cainozoic and Mesozoic periods are far
8,1310,profounder than the resemblances.
8,1315,The most fundamental of all these differences lies in the mental
8,1316,life of the two periods.  It arises essentially out of the
8,1317,continuing contact of parent and offspring which distinguishes
8,1318,"mammalian and in a lesser degree bird life, from the life of the"
8,1319,reptile.  With very few exceptions the reptile abandons its egg to
8,1320,hatch alone.  The young reptile has no knowledge whatever of its
8,1321,"parent; its mental life, such as it is, begins and ends with its"
8,1322,own experiences.  {39} It may tolerate the existence of its
8,1323,"fellows but it has no communication with them; it never imitates,"
8,1324,"never learns from them, is incapable of concerted action with"
8,1325,them.  Its life is that of an isolated individual.  But with the
8,1326,suckling and cherishing of young which was distinctive of the new
8,1327,mammalian and avian strains arose the possibility of learning by
8,1328,"imitation, of communication, by warning cries and other concerted"
8,1329,"action, of mutual control and instruction.  A teachable type of"
8,1330,life had come into the world.
8,1332,The earliest mammals of the Cainozoic period are but little
8,1333,"superior in brain size to the more active carnivorous dinosaurs,"
8,1334,"but as we read on through the record towards modern times we find,"
8,1335,"in every tribe and race of the mammalian animals, a steady"
8,1336,universal increase in brain capacity.  For instance we find at a
8,1337,comparatively early stage that rhinoceros-like beasts appear.
8,1338,"There is a creature, the Titanotherium, which lived in the"
8,1339,earliest division of this period.  It was probably very like a
8,1340,modern rhinoceros in its habits and needs.  But its brain capacity
8,1341,was not one tenth that of its living successor.
8,1343,The earlier mammals probably parted from their offspring as soon
8,1344,"as suckling was over, but, once the capacity for mutual"
8,1345,"understanding has arisen, the advantages of continuing the"
8,1346,association are very great; and we presently find a number of
8,1347,mammalian species displaying the beginnings of a true social life
8,1348,"and keeping together in herds, packs and flocks, watching each"
8,1349,"other, imitating each other, taking warning from each other's acts"
8,1350,and cries.  This is something that the world had not seen before
8,1351,among vertebrated animals.   Reptiles and fish may no doubt be
8,1352,found in swarms and shoals; they have been hatched in quantities
8,1353,"and similar conditions have kept them together, but in the case of"
8,1354,the social and gregarious mammals the association arises not
8,1355,"simply from a community of external forces, it is sustained by an"
8,1356,inner impulse.  They are not merely like one another and so found
8,1357,in the same places at the same times; they like one another and so
8,1358,they keep together.
8,1370,This difference between the reptile world and the world of our
8,1371,human minds is one our sympathies seem unable to pass.  We cannot
8,1372,conceive in ourselves the swift uncomplicated urgency of a
8,1373,"reptile's instinctive motives, its appetites, fears and hates.  We"
8,1374,{41} cannot understand them in their simplicity because all our
8,1375,motives are complicated; our's are balances and resultants and not
8,1376,simple urgencies.  But the mammals and birds have
8,1377,"self-restraint and consideration for other individuals, a social"
8,1378,"appeal, a self-control that is, at its lower level, after our own"
8,1379,fashion.  We can in consequence establish relations with almost
8,1380,all sorts of them.  When they suffer they utter cries and make
8,1381,movements that rouse our feelings.  We can make understanding pets
8,1382,of them with a mutual recognition.  They can be tamed to
8,1383,"self-restraint towards us, domesticated and taught."
8,1388,That unusual growth of brain which is the central fact of
8,1389,Cainozoic times marks a new communication and interdependence of
8,1390,individuals.  It foreshadows the development of human societies of
8,1391,which we shall soon be telling.
8,1393,"As the Cainozoic period unrolled, the resemblance of its flora and"
8,1394,fauna to the plants and animals that inhabit the world to-day {42}
8,1395,"increased.  The big clumsy Uintatheres and Titanotheres, the"
8,1396,"Entelodonts and Hyracodons, big clumsy brutes like nothing living,"
8,1397,disappeared.  On the other hand a series of forms led up by steady
8,1398,"degrees from grotesque and clumsy predecessors to the giraffes,"
8,1399,"camels, horses, elephants, deer, dogs and lions and tigers of the"
8,1400,existing world.  The evolution of the horse is particularly
8,1401,legible upon the geological record.  We have a fairly complete
8,1402,series of forms from a small tapir-like ancestor in the early
8,1403,Cainozoic.  Another line of development that has now been pieced
8,1404,together with some precision is that of the llamas and camels.
9,1416,Naturalists divide the class _Mammalia_ into a number of orders.
9,1417,"At the head of these is the order _Primates_, which includes the"
9,1418,"lemurs, the monkeys, apes and man.  Their classification was based"
9,1419,originally upon anatomical resemblances and took no account of any
9,1420,mental qualities.
9,1422,Now the past history of the Primates is one very difficult to
9,1423,decipher in the geological record.  They are for the most part
9,1424,animals which live in forests like the lemurs and monkeys or in
9,1425,bare rocky places like the baboons.  They are rarely drowned and
9,1426,"covered up by sediment, nor are most of them very numerous"
9,1427,"species, and so they do not figure so largely among the fossils as"
9,1428,"the ancestors of the horses, camels and so forth do.  But we know"
9,1429,"that quite early in the Cainozoic period, that is to say some"
9,1430,"forty million years ago or so, primitive monkeys and lemuroid"
9,1431,"creatures had appeared, poorer in brain and not so specialized as"
9,1432,their later successors.
9,1434,The great world summer of the middle Cainozoic period drew at last
9,1435,to an end.  It was to follow those other two great summers in the
9,1436,"history of life, the summer of the Coal Swamps and the vast summer"
9,1437,of the Age of Reptiles.  Once more the earth spun towards an ice
9,1438,"age.  The world chilled, grew milder for a time and chilled again."
9,1439,In the warm past hippopotami had wallowed through a lush
9,1440,"sub-tropical vegetation, and a tremendous tiger with fangs like"
9,1441,"sabres, the sabre-toothed tiger, had hunted its prey where now the"
9,1442,journalists of Fleet Street go to and fro.  Now came a bleaker age
9,1443,and still bleaker ages.  A great weeding and extinction of species
9,1444,"occurred.  A woolly rhinoceros, adapted to a cold climate, and the"
9,1445,"mammoth, a big woolly cousin of the elephants, the Arctic musk ox"
9,1446,and the reindeer passed across the scene.  Then century by century
9,1447,"the Arctic ice cap, the wintry death of the great Ice Age, crept"
9,1448,"{44} southward.  In England it came almost down to the Thames, in"
9,1449,America it reached Ohio.  There would be warmer spells of a few
9,1450,thousand years and relapses towards a bitterer cold.
9,1454,"Geologists talk of these wintry phases as the First, Second, Third"
9,1455,"and Fourth Glacial Ages, and of the interludes as Interglacial"
9,1456,periods.  We live to-day in a world that is still impoverished and
9,1457,scarred by that terrible winter.  The First Glacial Age was coming
9,1458,"on 600,000 years ago; the Fourth Glacial Age reached its bitterest"
9,1459,some fifty thousand years ago.  And it was amidst the snows of
9,1460,this long universal winter that the first man-like beings lived
9,1461,upon our planet.
9,1463,By the middle Cainozoic period there have appeared various apes
9,1464,"with many quasi-human attributes of the jaws and leg bones, but it"
9,1465,is only as we approach these Glacial Ages that we find traces of
9,1466,"creatures that we can speak of as ""almost human.""  These traces"
9,1467,"are not bones but implements.  In Europe, in deposits of this"
9,1468,"period, between half a million and a million years old, we find"
9,1469,flints {45} and stones that have evidently been chipped
9,1470,"intentionally by some handy creature desirous of hammering,"
9,1471,scraping or fighting with the sharpened edge.  These things have
9,1472,"been called ""Eoliths"" (dawn stones).  In Europe there are no bones"
9,1473,"nor other remains of the creature which made these objects, simply"
9,1474,the objects themselves.  For all the certainty we have it may have
9,1475,been some entirely un-human but intelligent monkey.  But at Trinil
9,1476,"in Java, in accumulations of this age, a piece of a skull and"
9,1477,"various teeth and bones have been found of a sort of ape man, with"
9,1478,"a brain case bigger than that of any living apes, which seems to"
9,1479,have walked erect.  This creature is now called _Pithecanthropus
9,1480,"erectus_, the walking ape man, and the little trayful of its bones"
9,1481,"is the only help our imaginations have as yet in figuring to,"
9,1482,ourselves the makers of the Eoliths.
9,1486,It is not until we come to sands that are almost a quarter of a
9,1487,million years old that we find any other particle of a sub-human
9,1488,"being.  But there are plenty of implements, and they are steadily"
9,1489,improving in quality as we read on through the record.  They are
9,1490,no longer clumsy Eoliths; they are now shapely instruments made
9,1491,with considerable skill.  _And they are much bigger than the
9,1492,"similar implements afterwards made by true man._ Then, in a"
9,1493,"sandpit at Heidelberg, appears a single quasi-human jaw-bone, a"
9,1494,"clumsy jaw-bone, absolutely chinless, far heavier than a true"
9,1495,"human jaw-bone and narrower, so that it is improbable the"
9,1496,creature's tongue could have moved about for articulate speech.
9,1497,"On the strength of this jaw-bone, scientific men suppose this"
9,1498,"creature to have been a heavy, almost human monster, possibly with"
9,1499,"huge limbs and hands, possibly with a thick felt of hair, and they"
9,1500,call it the Heidelberg Man.
9,1504,"This jaw-bone is, I think, one of the most tormenting objects in"
9,1505,the world to our human curiosity.  To see it is like looking
9,1506,through a defective glass into the past and catching just one
9,1507,"blurred and tantalizing glimpse of this Thing, shambling through"
9,1508,"the bleak wilderness, clambering to avoid the sabre-toothed tiger,"
9,1509,watching the woolly rhinoceros in the woods.  Then before we can
9,1510,"scrutinize the monster, he vanishes.  Yet the soil is littered"
9,1511,abundantly with the indestructible implements he chipped out for
9,1512,his uses.
9,1519,Still more fascinatingly enigmatical are the remains of a creature
9,1520,found at Piltdown in Sussex in a deposit that may indicate an age
9,1521,"between a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand years ago,"
9,1522,though some authorities would put these particular remains back in
9,1523,time to before the Heidelberg jaw-bone.  Here there {47} are the
9,1524,remains of a thick sub-human skull much larger than any existing
9,1525,"ape's, and a chimpanzee-like jaw-bone which may or may not belong"
9,1526,"to it, and, in addition, a bat-shaped piece of elephant bone"
9,1527,"evidently carefully manufactured, through which a hole had"
9,1528,apparently been bored.  There is also the thigh-bone of a deer
9,1529,with cuts upon it like a tally.  That is all.
9,1537,"Scientific men have named him Eoanthropus, the Dawn Man.  He"
9,1538,stands apart from his kindred; a very different being either from
9,1539,the Heidelberg creature or from any living ape.  No other vestige
9,1540,like him is known.  But the gravels and deposits of from one
9,1541,hundred thousand years onward are increasingly rich in implements
9,1542,of flint and similar stone.  And these implements are no longer
9,1543,"rude ""Eoliths."" The archaeologists are presently able to"
9,1544,"distinguish scrapers, borers, knives, darts, throwing stones and"
9,1545,hand axes ....
9,1547,We are drawing very near to man.  In our next section we shall
9,1548,have to describe the strangest of all these precursors of
9,1549,"humanity, the Neanderthalers, the men who were almost, but not"
9,1550,"quite, true men."
9,1552,But it may be well perhaps to state quite clearly here that no
9,1553,"scientific man supposes either of these creatures, the Heidelberg"
9,1554,"Man or _Eoanthropus_, to be direct ancestors of the men of to-day."
9,1555,"These are, at the closest, related forms."
10,1567,"About fifty or sixty thousand years ago, before the climax of the"
10,1568,"Fourth Glacial Age, there lived a creature on earth so like a man"
10,1569,that until a few years ago its remains were considered to be
10,1570,altogether human.  We have skulls and bones of it and a great
10,1571,accumulation of the large implements it made and used.  It made
10,1572,fires.  It sheltered in caves from the cold.  It probably dressed
10,1573,skins roughly and wore them.  It was right-handed as men are.
10,1575,Yet now the ethnologists tell us these creatures were not true
10,1576,men.  They were of a different species of the same genus.  They
10,1577,had heavy protruding jaws and great brow ridges above the eyes and
10,1578,very low foreheads.  Their thumbs were not opposable to the
10,1579,fingers as men's are; their necks were so poised that they could
10,1580,not turn back their heads and look up to the sky.  They probably
10,1581,"slouched along, head down and forward.  Their chinless jaw-bones"
10,1582,resemble the Heidelberg jaw-bone and are markedly unlike human
10,1583,jaw-bones.  And there were great differences from the human
10,1584,pattern in their teeth.  Their cheek teeth were more complicated
10,1585,"in structure than ours, more complicated and not less so; they had"
10,1586,not the long fangs of our cheek teeth; and also these quasi-men
10,1587,had not the marked canines (dog teeth) of an ordinary human being.
10,1588,"The capacity of their skulls was quite human, but the brain was"
10,1589,bigger behind and lower in front than the human brain.  Their
10,1590,intellectual faculties were differently arranged.  They were not
10,1591,ancestral to the human line. Mentally and physically they were
10,1592,upon a different line from the human line.
10,1594,Skulls and bones of this extinct species of man were found at
10,1595,"Neanderthal {49} among other places, and from that place these"
10,1596,"strange proto-men have been christened Neanderthal Men, or"
10,1597,Neanderthalers. They must have endured in Europe for many hundreds
10,1598,or even thousands of years.
10,1602,At that time the climate and geography of our world was very
10,1603,different from what they are at the present time. Europe for
10,1604,example was covered with ice reaching as far south as the Thames
10,1605,and into Central Germany and Russia; there was no Channel
10,1606,separating Britain from France; the Mediterranean and the Red Sea
10,1607,"were great valleys, with perhaps a chain of lakes in their deeper"
10,1608,"portions, and a great inland sea spread from the present Black Sea"
10,1609,across South Russia and far into Central Asia.  Spain and all of
10,1610,Europe not actually under ice consisted of bleak uplands under a
10,1611,"harder climate than that of Labrador, and it was only when North"
10,1612,Africa was reached that one would have found a temperate climate.
10,1613,Across the cold steppes of Southern Europe with its sparse arctic
10,1614,"vegetation, drifted such hardy creatures as the woolly mammoth,"
10,1615,"and woolly rhinoceros, great oxen and reindeer, no doubt following"
10,1616,the vegetation northward in spring and southward in autumn.
10,1623,"Such was the scene through which the Neanderthaler wandered,"
10,1624,gathering such subsistence as he could from small game or fruits
10,1625,"and berries and roots.  Possibly he was mainly a vegetarian,"
10,1626,chewing twigs and roots.  His level elaborate teeth suggest a
10,1627,largely vegetarian dietary.  But we also find the long marrow
10,1628,"bones of great animals in his caves, cracked to extract the"
10,1629,marrow.  His weapons could not have been of much avail in open
10,1630,"conflict with great beasts, but it is supposed that he attacked"
10,1631,them with spears at difficult river crossings and even constructed
10,1632,pitfalls for them.  Possibly he followed the herds and preyed upon
10,1633,"any dead that were killed in fights, and perhaps he played the"
10,1634,part of jackal to the sabre-toothed tiger which still survived in
10,1635,his day.  Possibly in the bitter hardships of the Glacial Ages
10,1636,this creature had taken to attacking animals after long ages of
10,1637,vegetarian adaptation.
10,1639,We cannot guess what this Neanderthal man looked like. He may have
10,1640,been very hairy and very unhuman-looking indeed.  It is even
10,1641,doubtful if he went erect.  He may have used his knuckles as well
10,1642,as his feet to hold himself up. Probably he went about {51} alone
10,1643,or in small family groups.  It is inferred from the structure of
10,1644,his jaw that he was incapable of speech as we understand it.
10,1646,For thousands of years these Neanderthalers were the highest
10,1647,animals that the European area had ever seen; and then some thirty
10,1648,or thirty-five thousand years ago as the climate grew warmer a
10,1649,"race of kindred beings, more intelligent, knowing more, talking"
10,1650,"and co-operating together, came drifting into the Neanderthaler's"
10,1651,world from the south.  They ousted the Neanderthalers from their
10,1652,caves and squatting places; they hunted the same food; they
10,1653,probably made war upon their grisly predecessors and killed them
10,1654,off.  These newcomers from the south or the east--for at present
10,1655,we do not know their region of origin--who at last drove the
10,1656,"Neanderthalers out of existence altogether, were beings of our own"
10,1657,"blood and kin, the first True Men.  Their brain-cases and thumbs"
10,1658,and necks and teeth were anatomically the same as our own.  In a
10,1659,"cave at Cro-Magnon and in another at Grimaldi, a number of"
10,1660,"skeletons have been found, the earliest truly human remains that"
10,1661,are so far known.
10,1663,"So it is our race comes into the Record of the Rocks, and the"
10,1669,The world was growing liker our own in those days though the
10,1670,climate was still austere.  The glaciers of the Ice Age were
10,1671,receding in Europe; the reindeer of France and Spain presently
10,1672,gave way to great herds of horses as grass increased upon the
10,1673,"steppes, and the {52} mammoth became more and more rare in"
10,1674,southern Europe and finally receded northward altogether ....
10,1676,We do not know where the True Men first originated.  But in the
10,1677,"summer of 1921, an extremely interesting skull was found together"
10,1678,"with pieces of a skeleton at Broken Hill in South Africa, which"
10,1679,"seems to be a relic of a third sort of man, intermediate in its"
10,1680,characteristics between the Neanderthaler and the human being.
10,1681,The brain-case indicates a brain bigger in front and smaller
10,1682,"behind than the Neanderthaler's, and the skull was poised erect"
10,1683,upon the backbone in a quite human way.  The teeth also and the
10,1684,bones are quite human.  But the face must have been ape-like with
10,1685,enormous brow ridges and a ridge along the middle of the skull.
10,1686,"The creature was indeed a true man, so to speak, with an ape-like,"
10,1687,Neanderthaler face.  This Rhodesian Man is evidently still closer
10,1688,to real men than the Neanderthal Man.
10,1690,This Rhodesian skull is probably only the second of what in the
10,1691,end may prove to be a long list of finds of sub-human species
10,1692,which lived on the earth in the vast interval of time between the
10,1693,"beginnings of the Ice Age and the appearance of their common heir,"
10,1694,"and perhaps their common exterminator, the True Man.  The"
10,1695,Rhodesian skull itself may not be very ancient.  Up to the time of
10,1696,publishing this book there has been no exact determination of its
10,1697,probable age. It may be that this sub-human creature survived in
10,1698,South Africa until quite recent times.
11,1710,"The earliest signs and traces at present known to science, of a"
11,1711,"humanity which is indisputably kindred with ourselves, have been"
11,1712,found in western Europe and particularly in France and Spain.
11,1713,"Bones, weapons, scratchings upon bone and rock, carved fragments"
11,1714,"of bone, and paintings in caves and upon rock surfaces dating, it"
11,1715,"is supposed, from 30,000 years ago or more, have been discovered"
11,1716,in both these countries. Spain is at present the richest country
11,1717,in the world in these first relics of our real human ancestors.
11,1719,Of course our present collections of these things are the merest
11,1720,"beginnings of the accumulations we may hope for in the future,"
11,1721,when there are searchers enough to make a thorough examination of
11,1722,"all possible sources and when other countries in the world, now"
11,1723,"inaccessible to archaeologists, have been explored in some detail."
11,1724,The greater part of Africa and Asia has never even been traversed
11,1725,yet by a trained observer interested in these matters and free to
11,1726,"explore, and we must be very careful therefore not to conclude"
11,1727,that the early true men were distinctively inhabitants of western
11,1728,Europe or that they first appeared in that region.
11,1730,In Asia or Africa or submerged beneath the sea of to-day there may
11,1731,be richer and much earlier deposits of real human remains than
11,1732,"anything that has yet come to light.  I write in Asia or Africa,"
11,1733,and I do not mention America because so far there have been no
11,1734,"finds at all of any of the higher Primates, either of great apes,"
11,1735,"sub-men, Neanderthalers nor early true men.  This development of"
11,1736,"life seems to have been an exclusively old world development, and"
11,1737,it was only apparently at the end of the Old Stone Age that human
11,1738,beings first made their way across the land connexion that is now
11,1739,"cut by Behring Straits, into the American continent."
11,1746,These first real human beings we know of in Europe appear already
11,1747,to have belonged to one or other of at least two very distinct
11,1748,races. One of these races was of a very high type indeed; it was
11,1749,tall and big brained.  One of the women's skulls found exceeds in
11,1750,capacity that of the average man of to-day.  One of the men's
11,1751,skeletons is over six feet in height.  The physical type resembled
11,1752,that of the North American Indian.  From the Cro-Magnon cave in
11,1753,which the first skeletons were found these people have been called
11,1754,"Cro-Magnards.  They were savages, but savages of a high order."
11,1755,"The second race, the race of the Grimaldi cave remains, was"
11,1756,distinctly negroid in its characters.  Its nearest living
11,1757,affinities are the Bushmen and Hottentots of South Africa.  It is
11,1758,"interesting to find at the very outset of the known human story,"
11,1759,that mankind was already racially divided into at least two main
11,1760,varieties; and one is tempted to such unwarrantable guesses as
11,1761,that the former race was probably brownish rather than black and
11,1762,"that it came from the East or North, and that the latter was"
11,1763,blackish rather than brown and came from the equatorial south.
11,1771,And these savages of perhaps forty thousand years ago were so
11,1772,"human that they pierced shells to make necklaces, painted"
11,1773,"themselves, carved images of bone and stone, scratched figures on"
11,1774,"rocks and bones, and painted rude but often very able sketches of"
11,1775,beasts and the like upon the smooth walls of caves and upon
11,1776,"inviting rock surfaces.  They made a great variety of implements,"
11,1777,much smaller in scale and finer than those of the Neanderthal men.
11,1778,"We have now in our museums great quantities of their implements,"
11,1779,"their statuettes, their rock drawings and the like."
11,1781,The earliest of them were hunters.  Their chief pursuit was the
11,1782,"wild horse, the little bearded pony of that time.  They followed"
11,1783,it as it moved after pasture.  And also they followed the bison.
11,1784,"They knew the mammoth, because they have left us strikingly"
11,1785,effective pictures of that creature.  To judge by one rather
11,1786,ambiguous drawing they trapped and killed it.
11,1788,They hunted with spears and throwing stones.  They do not seem to
11,1789,"have had the bow, and it is doubtful if they had yet learnt to"
11,1790,tame any animals.  They had no dogs.  There is one carving of a
11,1791,"horse's head and one or two drawings that suggest a bridled horse,"
11,1792,with a twisted skin or tendon round it.  But the little horses of
11,1793,"that age and region could not have carried a man, and if the horse"
11,1794,was domesticated it was used as a led horse.  It is doubtful and
11,1795,improbable that they had yet learnt the rather unnatural use of
11,1796,animal's milk as food.
11,1798,They do not seem to have erected any buildings though they may
11,1799,"have had tents of skins, and though they made clay figures they"
11,1800,never rose to the making of pottery.  Since they had no cooking
11,1801,implements their cookery must have been rudimentary or
11,1802,nonexistent.  They knew nothing of cultivation and nothing of any
11,1803,sort of basket work or woven cloth. Except for their robes of skin
11,1804,or fur they were naked painted savages.
11,1806,These earliest known men hunted the open steppes of Europe for a
11,1807,"hundred centuries perhaps, and then slowly drifted and changed"
11,1808,"before a change of climate.  Europe, century by century, was"
11,1809,growing milder and damper. Reindeer receded northward and
11,1810,"eastward, and bison and horse followed.  The steppes gave way to"
11,1811,"forests, and red deer took the place of horse and bison. There is"
11,1812,a {57} change in the character of the implements with this change
11,1813,in their application.  River and lake fishing becomes of great
11,1814,"importance to men, and fine implements of bone increased.  ""The"
11,1815,"bone needles of this age,"" says de Mortillet, ""are much superior"
11,1816,"to those of later, even historical times, down to the Renaissance."
11,1817,"The Romans, for example, never had needles comparable to those of"
11,1818,"this epoch."""
11,1822,Almost fifteen or twelve thousand years ago a fresh people drifted
11,1823,"into the south of Spain, and left very remarkable drawings of"
11,1824,themselves upon exposed rock faces there.  These were the Azilians
11,1825,(named from the Mas d'Azil cave).  They had the bow; they seem to
11,1826,have worn feather headdresses; they drew vividly; but also they
11,1827,had reduced their drawings to a sort of symbolism--a man for
11,1828,instance would be represented by a vertical dab with two or three
11,1829,horizontal dabs--that suggest the dawn of the writing idea.
11,1830,Against hunting sketches there are often marks like tallies.  One
11,1831,drawing shows two men smoking out a bees' nest.
11,1839,These are the latest of the men that we call Palaeolithic (Old
11,1840,Stone Age) because they had only chipped implements.  By ten or
11,1841,"twelve thousand years a new sort of life has dawned in Europe, men"
11,1842,have learnt not only to chip but to polish and grind stone
11,1843,"implements, and they have begun cultivation.  The Neolithic Age"
11,1844,(New Stone Age) was beginning.
11,1846,It is interesting to note that less than a century ago there still
11,1847,"survived in a remote part of the world, in Tasmania, a race of"
11,1848,human beings at a lower level of physical and intellectual
11,1849,development than any of these earliest races of mankind who have
11,1850,left traces in Europe.  These people had long ago been cut off by
11,1851,"geographical changes from the rest of the species, and from"
11,1852,stimulation and improvement.  They seem to have degenerated rather
11,1853,than developed.  They lived a base life subsisting upon shellfish
11,1854,and small game.  They had no habitations but only squatting
11,1855,"places.  They were real men of our species, but they had neither"
11,1856,the manual dexterity nor the artistic powers of the first true
11,1857,men.
12,1869,And now let us indulge in a very interesting speculation; how did
12,1870,it feel to be a man in those early days of the human adventure?
12,1871,How did men think and what did they think in those remote days of
12,1872,hunting and wandering four hundred centuries ago before seed time
12,1873,and harvest began.  Those were days long before the written record
12,1874,"of any human impressions, and we are left almost entirely to"
12,1875,inference and guesswork in our answers to these questions.
12,1877,The sources to which scientific men have gone in their attempts to
12,1878,reconstruct that primitive mentality are very various.  Recently
12,1879,"the science of psycho-analysis, which analyzes the way in which"
12,1880,"the egotistic and passionate impulses of the child are restrained,"
12,1881,"suppressed, modified or overlaid, to adapt them to the needs of"
12,1882,"social life, seems to have thrown a considerable amount of light"
12,1883,upon the history of primitive society; and another fruitful source
12,1884,of suggestion has been the study of the ideas and customs of such
12,1885,contemporary savages as still survive.  Again there is a sort of
12,1886,mental fossilization which we find in folk-lore and the deep-lying
12,1887,irrational superstitions and prejudices that still survive among
12,1888,modern civilized people.  And finally we have in the increasingly
12,1889,"numerous pictures, statues, carvings, symbols and the like, as we"
12,1890,"draw near to our own time, clearer and clearer indications of what"
12,1891,man found interesting and worthy of record and representation.
12,1893,"Primitive man probably thought very much as a child thinks, that"
12,1894,is to say in a series of imaginative pictures.  He conjured up
12,1895,"images or images presented themselves to his mind, and he acted in"
12,1896,accordance with the emotions they aroused.  So a child or an
12,1897,uneducated person does to-day.  Systematic thinking is apparently
12,1898,a comparatively late development in human experience; it has not
12,1899,{61} played any great part in human life until within the last
12,1900,three thousand years.  And even to-day those who really control
12,1901,and order their thoughts are but a small minority of mankind.
12,1902,Most of the world still lives by imagination and passion.
12,1904,"Probably the earliest human societies, in the opening stages of"
12,1905,"the true human story, were small family groups.  Just as the"
12,1906,flocks and herds of the earlier mammals arose out of families
12,1907,"which remained together and multiplied, so probably did the"
12,1908,earliest tribes.  But before this could happen a certain restraint
12,1909,upon the primitive egotisms of the individual had to be
12,1910,established.  The fear of the father and respect for the mother
12,1911,"had to be extended into adult life, and the natural jealousy of"
12,1912,the old man of the group for the younger males as they grew up had
12,1913,to be mitigated.  The mother on the other hand was the natural
12,1914,adviser and protector of the young.  Human social life grew up out
12,1915,of the reaction between the crude instinct of the young to go off
12,1916,"and pair by themselves as they grew up, on the one hand, and the"
12,1917,dangers and disadvantages of separation on the other.  An
12,1918,"anthropological writer of great genius, J. J. Atkinson, in his"
12,1919,"_Primal Law_, has shown how much of the customary law of savages,"
12,1920,"the _Tabus_, that are so remarkable a fact in tribal life, can be"
12,1921,ascribed to such a mental adjustment of the needs of the primitive
12,1922,"human animal to a developing social life, and the later work of"
12,1923,the psycho-analysts has done much to confirm his interpretation of
12,1924,these possibilities.
12,1926,Some speculative writers would have us believe that respect and
12,1927,fear of the Old Man and the emotional reaction of the primitive
12,1928,"savage to older protective women, exaggerated in dreams and"
12,1929,"enriched by fanciful mental play, played a large part in the"
12,1930,beginnings of primitive religion and in the conception of gods and
12,1931,goddesses.  Associated with this respect for powerful or helpful
12,1932,personalities was a dread and exaltation of such personages after
12,1933,"their deaths, due to their reappearance in dreams.  It was easy to"
12,1934,believe they were not truly dead but only fantastically
12,1935,transferred to a remoteness of greater power.
12,1937,"The dreams, imaginations and fears of a child are far more vivid"
12,1938,"and real than those of a modern adult, and primitive man was"
12,1939,always something of a child. He was nearer to the animals {62}
12,1940,"also, and he could suppose them to have motives and reactions like"
12,1941,"his own.  He could imagine animal helpers, animal enemies, animal"
12,1942,gods.  One needs to have been an imaginative child oneself to
12,1943,"realize again how important, significant, portentous or friendly,"
12,1944,"strangely shaped rocks, lumps of wood, exceptional trees or the"
12,1945,"like may have appeared to the men of the Old Stone Age, and how"
12,1946,dream and fancy would create stories and legends about such things
12,1947,that would become credible as they told them.  Some of these
12,1948,stories would be good enough to remember and tell again.  The
12,1949,women would tell them to the children and so establish a
12,1950,tradition.  To this day most imaginative children invent long
12,1951,stories in which some favourite doll or animal or some fantastic
12,1952,"semi-human being figures as the hero, and primitive man probably"
12,1953,did the same--with a much stronger disposition to believe his hero
12,1954,real.
12,1958,For the very earliest of the true men that we know of were
12,1959,probably quite talkative beings.  In that way they have differed
12,1960,from the Neanderthalers and had an advantage over them.  The
12,1961,Neanderthaler may have been a dumb animal. Of course the primitive
12,1962,"{63} human speech was probably a very scanty collection of names,"
12,1963,and may have been eked out with gestures and signs.
12,1965,There is no sort of savage so low as not to have a kind of science
12,1966,of cause and effect.  But primitive man was not very critical in
12,1967,his associations of cause with effect; he very easily connected an
12,1968,"effect with something quite wrong as its cause. ""You do so and"
12,1969,"so,"" he said, ""and so and so happens.""  You give a child a"
12,1970,poisonous berry and it dies.  You eat the heart of a valiant enemy
12,1971,and you become strong.  There we have two bits of cause and effect
12,1972,"association, one true one false.  We call the system of cause and"
12,1973,"effect in the mind of a savage, Fetish; but Fetish is simply"
12,1974,savage science.  It differs from modern science in that it is
12,1975,totally unsystematic and uncritical and so more frequently wrong.
12,1979,"In many cases it is not difficult to link cause and effect, in"
12,1980,{64} many others erroneous ideas were soon corrected by
12,1981,experience; but there was a large series of issues of very great
12,1982,"importance to primitive man, where he sought persistently for"
12,1983,causes and found explanations that were wrong but not sufficiently
12,1984,wrong nor so obviously wrong as to be detected.  It was a matter
12,1985,of great importance to him that game should be abundant or fish
12,1986,"plentiful and easily caught, and no doubt he tried and believed in"
12,1987,"a thousand charms, incantations and omens to determine these"
12,1988,desirable results.  Another great concern of his was illness and
12,1989,death.  Occasionally infections crept through the land and men
12,1990,died of them.  Occasionally men were stricken by illness and died
12,1991,or were enfeebled without any manifest cause.  This too must have
12,1992,"given the hasty, emotional mind of primitive man much feverish"
12,1993,"exercise.  Dreams and fantastic guesses made him blame this, or"
12,1994,appeal for help to that man or beast or thing.  He had the child's
12,1995,aptitude for fear and panic.
12,1997,"Quite early in the little human tribe, older, steadier minds"
12,1998,"sharing the fears, sharing the imaginations, but a little more"
12,1999,"forceful than the others, must have asserted themselves, to"
12,2000,"advise, to prescribe, to command. This they declared unpropitious"
12,2001,"and that imperative, this an omen of good and that an omen of"
12,2002,"evil.  The expert in Fetish, the Medicine Man, was the first"
12,2003,"priest.  He exhorted, he interpreted dreams, he warned, he"
12,2004,performed the complicated hocus pocus that brought luck or averted
12,2005,calamity.  Primitive religion was not so much what we now call
12,2006,"religion as practice and observance, and the early priest dictated"
12,2007,what was indeed an arbitrary primitive practical science.
13,2019,We are still very ignorant about the beginnings of cultivation and
13,2020,settlement in the world although a vast amount of research and
13,2021,speculation has been given to these matters in the last fifty
13,2022,years.  All that we can say with any confidence at present is that
13,2023,"somewhen about 15,000 and 12,000 B.C. while the Azilian people"
13,2024,were in the south of Spain and while the remnants of the earlier
13,2025,"hunters were drifting northward and eastward, somewhere in North"
13,2026,Africa or Western Asia or in that great Mediterranean valley that
13,2027,"is now submerged under the waters of the Mediterranean sea, there"
13,2028,"were people who, age by age, were working out two vitally"
13,2029,important things; they were beginning cultivation and they were
13,2030,"domesticating animals.  They were also beginning to make, in"
13,2031,"addition to the chipped implements of their hunter forebears,"
13,2032,implements of polished stone.  They had discovered the possibility
13,2033,"of basketwork and roughly woven textiles of plant fibre, and they"
13,2034,were beginning to make a rudely modelled pottery.
13,2036,"They were entering upon a new phase in human culture, the"
13,2037,Neolithic phase (New Stone Age) as distinguished from the
13,2038,"Palaeolithic (Old Stone) phase of the Cro-Magnards, the Grimaldi"
13,2039,"people, the Azilians and their like.  [1]  Slowly these Neolithic"
13,2040,people spread over the warmer parts of the world; and the arts
13,2041,"they had mastered, the plants and animals they had learnt to use,"
13,2042,spread by imitation and acquisition even more widely than they
13,2043,"did.  By 10,000 B.C., most of mankind was at the Neolithic level."
13,2047,"Now the ploughing of land, the sowing of seed, the reaping of"
13,2048,"harvest, threshing and grinding, may seem the most obviously"
13,2049,reasonable steps to a modern mind just as to a modern mind it is a
13,2050,commonplace that the world is round.  What else could you do?
13,2051,people will ask.  What else can it be?  But to the primitive man
13,2052,of twenty thousand years ago neither of the systems of action and
13,2053,reasoning that seem so sure and manifest to us to-day were at all
13,2054,obvious.  He felt his way to effectual practice through a
13,2055,"multitude of trials and misconceptions, with fantastic and"
13,2056,unnecessary elaborations and false interpretations at every turn.
13,2057,"Somewhere in the Mediterranean region, wheat grew wild; and man"
13,2058,may have learnt to pound and then grind up its seeds for food long
13,2059,before he learnt to sow.  He reaped before he sowed.
13,2061,And it is a very remarkable thing that throughout the world
13,2062,wherever there is sowing and harvesting there is still traceable
13,2063,the vestiges of a strong primitive association of the idea of
13,2064,"sowing with the idea of a blood sacrifice, and primarily of the"
13,2065,sacrifice of a human being.  The study of the original
13,2066,entanglement of these two things is a profoundly attractive one to
13,2067,the curious mind; the interested reader will find it very fully
13,2068,"developed in that monumental work, Sir J. G. Frazer's _Golden"
13,2069,"Bough_.  It was an entanglement, we must remember, in the"
13,2070,"childish, dreaming, myth-making primitive mind; no reasoned"
13,2071,"process will explain it.  But in that world of 12,000 to 20,000"
13,2072,"years ago, it would seem that whenever seed time came round to the"
13,2073,Neolithic peoples there was a human sacrifice.  And it was not the
13,2074,sacrifice of any mean or outcast person; it was the sacrifice
13,2075,"usually of a chosen youth or maiden, a youth more often who was"
13,2076,treated with profound deference and even worship up to the moment
13,2077,"of his immolation.  He was a sort of sacrificial god-king, and all"
13,2078,the details of his killing had become a ritual directed by the
13,2079,"old, knowing men and sanctioned by the accumulated usage of ages."
13,2089,"At first primitive men, with only a very rough idea of the"
13,2090,"seasons, must have found great difficulty in determining when was"
13,2091,the propitious moment for the seed-time sacrifice and the sowing.
13,2092,There is some reason for supposing that there was an early stage
13,2093,in human experience when men had no idea of a year. The first {68}
13,2094,chronology was in lunar months; it is supposed that the years of
13,2095,"the Biblical patriarchs are really moons, and the Babylonian"
13,2096,calendar shows distinct traces of an attempt to reckon seed time
13,2097,by taking thirteen lunar months to see it round. This lunar
13,2098,influence upon the calendar reaches down to our own days. If usage
13,2099,did not dull our sense of its strangeness we should think it a
13,2100,very remarkable thing indeed that the Christian Church does not
13,2101,commemorate the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ on the
13,2102,proper anniversaries but on dates that vary year by year with the
13,2103,phases of the moon.
13,2107,It may be doubted whether the first agriculturalists made any
13,2108,observation of the stars.  It is more likely that stars were first
13,2109,"observed by migratory herdsmen, who found them a convenient mark"
13,2110,of direction.  But once their use in determining seasons was
13,2111,"realized, their importance to agriculture became very great.  The"
13,2112,seed-time sacrifice was linked up with the southing or northing of
13,2113,some prominent star.  A myth and worship of that star was for
13,2114,primitive man an almost inevitable consequence.
13,2116,It is easy to see how important the man of knowledge and
13,2117,"experience, the man who knew about the blood sacrifice and the"
13,2118,"stars, became in this early Neolithic world."
13,2120,"The fear of uncleanness and pollution, and the methods of"
13,2121,"cleansing that were advisable, constituted another source of power"
13,2122,for the knowledgeable men and women. For there have always been
13,2123,"witches as well as wizards, and priestesses as well as priests."
13,2124,The early priest was really not so much a {69} religious man as a
13,2125,man of applied science.  His science was generally empirical and
13,2126,often bad; he kept it secret from the generality of men very
13,2127,jealously; but that does not alter the fact that his primary
13,2128,function was knowledge and that his primary use was a practical
13,2129,use.
13,2133,"Twelve or fifteen thousand years ago, in all the warm and fairly"
13,2134,well-watered parts of the Old World these Neolithic human
13,2135,"communities, with their class and tradition of priests and"
13,2136,priestesses and their cultivated fields and their development of
13,2137,"villages and little walled cities, were spreading.  Age by age a"
13,2138,drift and exchange of ideas went on between these communities.
13,2139,"Eliot Smith and Rivers have used the term ""Heliolithic culture"""
13,2140,for the culture of these first agricultural peoples.
13,2141,"""Heliolithic"" (Sun and Stone) is not perhaps the best possible"
13,2142,"word to use for this, but until scientific men give us a better"
13,2143,one we shall have to use it.  Originating somewhere in the
13,2144,"Mediterranean and western Asiatic area, it spread age by age"
13,2145,eastward and from island to island across the Pacific until it may
13,2146,even have reached America and mingled with the more primitive ways
13,2147,of living of the Mongoloid immigrants coming down from the North.
13,2149,Wherever the brownish people with the Heliolithic culture went
13,2150,they took with them all or most of a certain group of curious
13,2151,ideas and practices.  Some of them are such queer ideas that they
13,2152,call for the explanation of the mental expert.  They made pyramids
13,2153,"{70} and great mounds, and set up great circles of big stones,"
13,2154,perhaps to facilitate the astronomical observation of the priests;
13,2155,they made mummies of some or all of their dead; they tattooed and
13,2156,"circumcized; they had the old custom, known as the _couvade_, of"
13,2157,"sending the _father_ to bed and rest when a child was born, and"
13,2158,they had as a luck symbol the well-known Swastika.
13,2160,If we were to make a map of the world with dots to show how far
13,2161,"these group practices have left their traces, we should make a"
13,2162,belt along the temperate and sub-tropical coasts of the world from
13,2163,Stonehenge and Spain across the world to Mexico and Peru.  But
13,2164,"Africa below the equator, north central Europe, and north Asia"
13,2165,would show none of these dottings; there lived races who were
13,2166,developing along practically independent lines.
13,2168,[1] The term Palaeolithic we may note is also used to cover the
13,2169,Neanderthaler and even the Eolithic implements.  The pre-human age
13,2170,"is called the ""Older Palaeolithic;"" the age of true men using"
13,2171,"unpolished stones in the ""Newer Palaeolithic."""
14,2183,"About 10,000 B.C. the geography of the world was very similar in"
14,2184,its general outline to that of the world to-day.  It is probable
14,2185,that by that time the great barrier across the Straits of
14,2186,Gibraltar that had hitherto banked back the ocean waters from the
14,2187,"Mediterranean valley had been eaten through, and that the"
14,2188,Mediterranean was a sea following much the same coastlines as it
14,2189,does now.  The Caspian Sea was probably still far more extensive
14,2190,"than it is at present, and it may have been continuous with the"
14,2191,Black Sea to the north of the Caucasus Mountains.  About this
14,2192,great Central Asian sea lands that are now steppes and deserts
14,2193,were fertile and habitable.  Generally it was a moister and more
14,2194,fertile world.  European Russia was much more a land of swamp and
14,2195,"lake than it is now, and there may still have been a land"
14,2196,connexion between Asia and America at Behring Straits.
14,2198,It would have been already possible at that time to have
14,2199,distinguished the main racial divisions of mankind as we know them
14,2200,to-day.  Across the warm temperate regions of this rather warmer
14,2201,"and better-wooded world, and along the coasts, stretched the"
14,2202,"brownish peoples of the Heliolithic culture, the ancestors of the"
14,2203,"bulk of the living inhabitants of the Mediterranean world, of the"
14,2204,"Berbers, the Egyptians and of much of the population of South and"
14,2205,Eastern Asia.  This great race had of course a number of
14,2206,"varieties.  The Iberian or Mediterranean or ""dark-white"" race of"
14,2207,"the Atlantic and Mediterranean coast, the ""Hamitic"" peoples which"
14,2208,"include the Berbers and Egyptians, the Dravidians; the darker"
14,2209,"people of India, a multitude of East Indian people, many"
14,2210,Polynesian races and the Maoris are all divisions of various value
14,2211,of this great main mass of humanity.  Its western varieties are
14,2212,whiter than its eastern.  In the forests of central and northern
14,2213,Europe a more blonde variety {72} of men with blue eyes was
14,2214,"becoming distinguishable, branching off from the main mass of"
14,2215,"brownish people, a variety which many people now speak of as the"
14,2216,Nordic race.  In the more open regions of northeastern Asia was
14,2217,another differentiation of this brownish humanity in the direction
14,2218,"of a type with more oblique eyes, high cheek-bones, a yellowish"
14,2219,"skin, and very straight black hair, the Mongolian peoples.  In"
14,2220,"South Africa, Australia, in many tropical islands in the south of"
14,2221,Asia were remains of the early negroid peoples. The central parts
14,2222,of Africa were already a region of racial intermixture.  Nearly
14,2223,all the coloured races of Africa to-day seem to be blends of the
14,2224,brownish peoples of the north with a negroid substratum.
14,2229,We have to remember that human races can all interbreed freely and
14,2230,"that they separate, mingle and reunite as clouds do.  Human races"
14,2231,do not branch out like trees with branches that never come
14,2232,"together again.  It is a thing we need to bear constantly in mind,"
14,2233,this remingling of races at any opportunity.  It will save us from
14,2234,many cruel delusions and prejudices if we do so.  People will use
14,2235,"such a word as race in the loosest manner, and base the most"
14,2236,preposterous generalizations upon it.  They will speak of a
14,2237,"""British"" {73} race or of a ""European"" race.  But nearly all the"
14,2238,"European nations are confused mixtures of brownish, dark-white,"
14,2239,white and Mongolian elements.
14,2243,It was at the Neolithic phase of human development that peoples of
14,2244,the Mongolian breed first made their way into America.  Apparently
14,2245,they came by way of Behring Straits and spread southward.  They
14,2246,"found caribou, the American reindeer, in the north and great {74}"
14,2247,herds of bison in the south.  When they reached South America
14,2248,"there were still living the Glyptodon, a gigantic armadillo, and"
14,2249,"the Megatherium, a monstrous clumsy sloth as high as an elephant."
14,2250,"They probably exterminated the latter beast, which was as helpless"
14,2251,as it was big.
14,2253,The greater portion of these American tribes never rose above a
14,2254,hunting nomadic Neolithic life.  They never discovered the use of
14,2255,"iron, and their chief metal possessions were native gold and"
14,2256,"copper.  But in Mexico, Yucatan and Peru conditions existed"
14,2257,"favourable to settled cultivation, and here about 1000 B.C. or so"
14,2258,arose very interesting civilizations of a parallel but different
14,2259,type from the old-world civilization.  Like the much earlier
14,2260,primitive civilizations of the old world these communities
14,2261,displayed a great development of human sacrifice about the
14,2262,"processes of seed time and harvest; but while in the old world, as"
14,2263,"we shall see, these primary ideas were ultimately mitigated,"
14,2264,"complicated and overlaid by others, in America they developed and"
14,2265,"were elaborated, to a very high degree of intensity.  These"
14,2266,American civilized countries were essentially priest-ruled
14,2267,countries; their war chiefs and rulers were under a rigorous rule
14,2268,of law and omen.
14,2270,These priests carried astronomical science to a high level of
14,2271,accuracy.  They knew their year better than the Babylonians of
14,2272,whom we shall presently tell.  In Yucatan they had a kind of
14,2273,"writing, the Maya writing, of the most curious and elaborate"
14,2274,"character.  So far as we have been able to decipher it, it was"
14,2275,used mainly for keeping the exact and complicated calendars upon
14,2276,which the priests expended their intelligence.  The art of the
14,2277,Maya civilization came to a climax about 700 or 800 A.D.  The
14,2278,sculptured work of these people amazes the modern observer by its
14,2279,"great plastic power and its frequent beauty, and perplexes him by"
14,2280,a grotesqueness and by a sort of insane conventionality and
14,2281,intricacy outside the circle of his ideas.  There is nothing quite
14,2282,"like it in the old world.  The nearest approach, and that is a"
14,2283,"remote one, is found in archaic Indian carvings.  Everywhere there"
14,2284,are woven feathers and serpents twine in and out.  Many Maya
14,2285,inscriptions resemble a certain sort of elaborate drawing made by
14,2286,"lunatics in European asylums, more than any other"
14,2287,old-world work.  It is as if the Maya mind {75} had developed upon
14,2288,"a different line from the old-world mind, had a different twist to"
14,2289,"its ideas, was not, by old-world standards, a rational mind at"
14,2290,all.
14,2292,This linking of these aberrant American civilizations to the idea
14,2293,of a general mental aberration finds support in their
14,2294,extraordinary obsession by the shedding of human blood.  The
14,2295,Mexican civilization in particular ran blood; it offered thousands
14,2296,"of human victims yearly.  The cutting open of living victims, the"
14,2297,"tearing out of the still beating heart, was an act that dominated"
14,2298,the minds and lives of these strange priesthoods.  The public
14,2299,"life, the national festivities all turned on this fantastically"
14,2300,horrible act.
14,2304,The ordinary existence of the common people in these communities
14,2305,was very like the ordinary existence of any other barbaric
14,2306,"peasantry.  Their pottery, weaving and dyeing was very good.  The"
14,2307,Maya writing was not only carven on stone but written and painted
14,2308,upon skins and the like.  The European and American museums
14,2309,contain many enigmatical Maya manuscripts of which at present
14,2310,little has been deciphered except the dates.  In Peru there were
14,2311,beginnings of a similar writing but they were superseded by a
14,2312,method of keeping records by knotting {76} cords.  A similar
14,2313,method of mnemonics was in use in China thousands of years ago.
14,2315,"In the old world before 4000 or 5000 B.C., that is to say three or"
14,2316,"four thousand years earlier, there were primitive civilizations"
14,2317,not unlike these American civilizations; civilizations based upon
14,2318,"a temple, having a vast quantity of blood sacrifices and with an"
14,2319,intensely astronomical priesthood.  But in the old world the
14,2320,primitive civilizations reacted upon one another and developed
14,2321,towards the conditions of our own world.  In America these
14,2322,primitive civilizations never progressed beyond this primitive
14,2323,stage.  Each of them was in a little world of its own.  Mexico it
14,2324,"seems knew little or nothing of Peru, until the Europeans came to"
14,2325,"America.  The potato, which was the principal food stuff in Peru,"
14,2326,was unknown in Mexico.
14,2328,Age by age these peoples lived and marvelled at their gods and
14,2329,made their sacrifices and died.  Maya art rose to high levels of
14,2330,decorative beauty.  Men made love and tribes made war.  Drought
14,2331,"and plenty, pestilence and health, followed one another.  The"
14,2332,priests elaborated their calendar and their sacrificial ritual
14,2333,"through long centuries, but made little progress in other"
14,2334,directions.
15,2346,"The old world is a wider, more varied stage than the new.  By 6000"
15,2347,or 7000 B.C. there were already quasi-civilized communities almost
15,2348,"at the Peruvian level, appearing in various fertile regions of"
15,2349,Asia and in the Nile valley.  At that time north Persia and
15,2350,western Turkestan and south Arabia were all more fertile than they
15,2351,"are now, and there are traces of very early communities in these"
15,2352,regions.  It is in lower Mesopotamia however and in Egypt that
15,2353,"there first appear cities, temples, systematic irrigation, and"
15,2354,evidences of a social organization rising above the level of a
15,2355,mere barbaric village-town.  In those days the Euphrates and
15,2356,"Tigris flowed by separate mouths into the Persian Gulf, and it was"
15,2357,in the country between them that the Sumerians built their first
15,2358,"cities.  About the same time, for chronology is still vague, the"
15,2359,great history of Egypt was beginning.
15,2361,These Sumerians appear to have been a brownish people with
15,2362,prominent noses.  They employed a sort of writing that has been
15,2363,"deciphered, and their language is now known.  They had discovered"
15,2364,the use of bronze and they built great tower-like temples of
15,2365,sun-dried brick. The clay of this country is very fine; they used
15,2366,"it to write upon, and so it is that their inscriptions have been"
15,2367,"preserved to us.  They had cattle, sheep, goats and asses, but no"
15,2368,"horses.  They fought on foot, in close formation, carrying spears"
15,2369,and shields of skin.  Their clothing was of wool and they shaved
15,2370,their heads.
15,2372,Each of the Sumerian cities seems generally to have been an
15,2373,independent state with a god of its own and priests of its own.
15,2374,But sometimes one city would establish an ascendancy over others
15,2375,and exact tribute from their population.  A very ancient
15,2376,"inscription {78}at Nippur records the ""empire,"" the first recorded"
15,2377,"empire, of the Sumerian city of Erech.  Its god and its"
15,2378,priest-king claimed an authority from the Persian Gulf to
15,2379,the Red Sea.
15,2384,At first writing was merely an abbreviated method of pictorial
15,2385,record.  Even before Neolithic times men were beginning to write.
15,2386,The Azilian rock pictures to which we have already referred show
15,2387,the beginning of the process.  Many of them record hunts and
15,2388,"expeditions, and in most of these the human figures are plainly"
15,2389,drawn.  But in some the painter would not bother with head and
15,2390,limbs; he just indicated men by a vertical and one or two
15,2391,transverse strokes.  From this to a conventional condensed picture
15,2392,"writing was an easy transition.  In Sumeria, where the writing was"
15,2393,"done on clay with a stick, the dabs of the characters soon became"
15,2394,"unrecognizably unlike the things they stood for, but in Egypt"
15,2395,where men painted on walls and on strips of the papyrus reed (the
15,2396,first paper) the likeness to the thing imitated remained.  From
15,2397,the fact that the wooden styles used in Sumeria made wedge-shaped
15,2398,"marks, the Sumerian writing is called cuneiform (= wedge-shaped)."
15,2404,An important step towards writing was made when pictures were used
15,2405,to indicate not the thing represented but some similar thing.  In
15,2406,"the rebus dear to children of a suitable age, this is still done"
15,2407,"to-day.  We draw a camp with tents and a bell, and the child is"
15,2408,delighted to guess that this is the Scotch name Campbell.  The
15,2409,Sumerian language was a language made up of accumulated syllables
15,2410,"rather like some contemporary Amerindian languages, and it lent"
15,2411,itself very readily to this syllabic method of writing words
15,2412,expressing ideas that could not be conveyed by pictures directly.
15,2413,"Egyptian writing underwent parallel developments.  Later on, when"
15,2414,foreign peoples with less distinctly syllabled methods of speech
15,2415,were to learn and use these picture scripts they were to make
15,2416,those further modifications and simplifications that developed at
15,2417,last into alphabetical writing.  All the true alphabets of the
15,2418,later world derived from a mixture of the Sumerian cuneiform and
15,2419,the Egyptian hieroglyphic (priest writing).  Later in China there
15,2420,"was to develop a conventionalized picture writing, but in China it"
15,2421,never got to the alphabetical stage.
15,2425,The invention of writing was of very great importance in the
15,2426,"development of human societies.  It put agreements, laws,"
15,2427,commandments on record.  It made the growth of states larger than
15,2428,the old city states possible.  It made a continuous historical
15,2429,consciousness possible.  The command of the priest or king and his
15,2430,seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his
15,2431,death.  It is interesting to note that in ancient Sumeria seals
15,2432,were greatly used.  A king or a nobleman or a merchant would have
15,2433,"his seal often very artistically carved, and would impress it on"
15,2434,any clay document he wished to authorize.  So close had
15,2435,civilization got to printing six thousand years ago.  Then the
15,2436,clay was dried hard and became permanent.  For the reader must
15,2437,"remember that in the land of Mesopotamia for countless years,"
15,2438,"letters, records and accounts were all written on comparatively"
15,2439,indestructible tiles.  To that fact we owe a great wealth of
15,2440,recovered knowledge.
15,2444,"Bronze, copper, gold, silver and, as a precious rarity, meteoric"
15,2445,iron were known in both Sumeria and Egypt at a very early stage.
15,2462,Daily life in those first city lands of the old world must have
15,2463,been {83} very similar in both Egypt and Sumeria.  And except for
15,2464,the asses and cattle in the streets it must have been not unlike
15,2465,the life in the Maya cities of America three or four thousand
15,2466,years later.  Most of the people in peace time were busy with
15,2467,irrigation and cultivation--except on days of religious festivity.
15,2468,They had no money and no need for it.  They managed their small
15,2469,occasional trades by barter.  The princes and rulers who alone had
15,2470,more than a few possessions used gold and silver bars and precious
15,2471,stones for any incidental act of trade.  The temple dominated
15,2472,life; in Sumeria it was a great towering temple that went up to a
15,2473,roof from which the stars were observed; in Egypt it was a massive
15,2474,building with only a ground floor. In Sumeria the priest ruler was
15,2475,"the greatest, most splendid of beings.  In Egypt however there was"
15,2476,one who was raised above the priests; he was the living
15,2477,"incarnation of the chief god of the land, the Pharaoh, the god"
15,2478,king.
15,2480,There were few changes in the world in those days; men's days were
15,2481,"sunny, toilsome and conventional.  Few strangers came into the"
15,2482,land and such as did fared uncomfortably.  The priest directed
15,2483,life according to immemorial rules and watched the stars for seed
15,2484,time and marked the omens of the sacrifices and interpreted the
15,2485,"warnings of dreams.  Men worked and loved and died, not unhappily,"
15,2486,forgetful of the savage past of their race and heedless of its
15,2487,"future.  Sometimes the ruler was benign.  Such was Pepi II, who"
15,2488,reigned in Egypt for ninety years.  Sometimes he was ambitious and
15,2489,took men's sons to be soldiers and sent them against neighbouring
15,2490,"city states to war and plunder, or he made them toil to build"
15,2491,"great buildings.  Such were Cheops and Chephren and Mycerinus, who"
15,2492,"built those vast sepulchral piles, the pyramids at Gizeh.  The"
15,2493,largest of these is 450 feet high and the weight of stone in it is
15,2494,"4,883,000 tons.  All this was brought down the Nile in boats and"
15,2495,lugged into place chiefly by human muscle.  Its erection must have
15,2496,exhausted Egypt more than a great war would have done.
16,2507,It was not only in Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley that men were
16,2508,settling down to agriculture and the formation of city states in
16,2509,the centuries between 6000 and 8000 B.C.  Wherever there were
16,2510,possibilities of irrigation and a steady all-the-year-round food
16,2511,supply men were exchanging the uncertainties and hardships of
16,2512,hunting and wandering for the routines of settlement.  On the
16,2513,upper Tigris a people called the Assyrians were founding cities;
16,2514,in the valleys of Asia Minor and on the Mediterranean shores and
16,2515,"islands, there were small communities growing up to civilization."
16,2516,Possibly parallel developments of human life were already going on
16,2517,"in favourable regions of India, and China.  In many parts of"
16,2518,"Europe where there were lakes well stocked with fish, little"
16,2519,communities of men had long settled in dwellings built on piles
16,2520,"over the water, and were eking out agriculture by fishing and"
16,2521,hunting. But over much larger areas of the old world no such
16,2522,"settlement was possible.  The land was too harsh, too thickly"
16,2523,"wooded or too arid, or the seasons too uncertain for mankind, with"
16,2524,only the implements and science of that age to take root.
16,2526,For settlement under the conditions of the primitive civilizations
16,2527,men needed a constant water supply and warmth and sunshine.  Where
16,2528,"these needs were not satisfied, man could live as a transient, as"
16,2529,"a hunter following his game, as a herdsman following the seasonal"
16,2530,"grass, but he could not settle.  The transition from the hunting"
16,2531,to the herding life may have been very gradual.  From following
16,2532,"herds of wild cattle or (in Asia) wild horses, men may have come"
16,2533,"to an idea of property in them, have learnt to pen them into"
16,2534,"valleys, have fought for them against wolves, wild dogs and other"
16,2535,predatory beasts.
16,2545,So while the primitive civilizations of the cultivators were
16,2546,"growing up chiefly in the great river valleys, a different way of"
16,2547,"living, the nomadic life, a life in constant movement to and fro"
16,2548,"from winter pasture to summer pasture, was also growing up.  The"
16,2549,nomadic peoples were on the whole hardier than the
16,2550,"agriculturalists; they were less prolific and numerous, they had"
16,2551,no permanent temples and no highly organized priesthood; they had
16,2552,less gear; but the reader must not suppose that theirs was
16,2553,necessarily a less highly developed way of living on that account.
16,2554,In many ways this free life was a fuller life than that of the
16,2555,tillers of the soil.  The individual was more
16,2556,self-reliant; less of a unit in a crowd.  The leader was more
16,2557,important; the medicine man perhaps less so.
16,2563,Moving over large stretches of country the nomad took a wider view
16,2564,of life.  He touched on the confines of this settled land and
16,2565,that.  He was used to the sight of strange faces.  He had to
16,2566,scheme and treat for pasture with competing tribes.  He knew more
16,2567,of minerals than the folk upon the plough lands because he went
16,2568,over mountain passes and into rocky places.  He may have been a
16,2569,better metallurgist.  Possibly bronze and much more probably iron
16,2570,smelting were nomadic discoveries.  Some of the earliest
16,2571,implements of iron reduced from its ores have been found in
16,2572,Central Europe far away from the early civilizations.
16,2578,On the other hand the settled folk had their textiles and their
16,2579,pottery and made many desirable things.  It was inevitable that as
16,2580,"the two sorts of life, the agricultural and the nomadic"
16,2581,"differentiated, a certain amount of looting and trading should"
16,2582,develop between the two.  In Sumeria particularly which had
16,2583,deserts and seasonal {88} country on either hand it must have been
16,2584,"usual to have the nomads camping close to the cultivated fields,"
16,2585,"trading and stealing and perhaps tinkering, as gipsies do to this"
16,2586,"day.  (But hens they would not steal, because the domestic"
16,2587,fowl--an Indian jungle fowl originally was not domesticated by man
16,2588,until about 1000 B.C.)  They would bring precious stones and things
16,2589,of metal and leather.  If they were hunters they would bring skins.
16,2590,"They would get in exchange pottery and beads and glass, garments"
16,2591,and suchlike manufactured things.
16,2595,Three main regions and three main kinds of wandering and
16,2596,imperfectly settled people there were in those remote days of the
16,2597,first civilizations in Sumeria and early Egypt.  Away in the
16,2598,"forests of Europe were the blonde Nordic peoples, hunters and"
16,2599,"herdsmen, a lowly race.  The primitive civilizations saw very"
16,2600,little of this race before 1500 B.C.  Away on the steppes of
16,2601,"eastern Asia various Mongolian tribes, the Hunnish peoples, were"
16,2602,domesticating the horse and developing a very wide sweeping habit
16,2603,of seasonal movement between their summer and winter camping
16,2604,places.  Possibly the Nordic and Hunnish peoples were still
16,2605,separated from one another by the swamps of Russia and the greater
16,2606,Caspian Sea of that time.  For very much of Russia there was swamp
16,2607,"and lake.  In the deserts, which were growing more arid now, of"
16,2608,"Syria and Arabia, tribes of a dark white or brownish people, the"
16,2609,"Semitic tribes, were driving flocks of sheep and goats and asses"
16,2610,from pasture to pasture.  It was these Semitic shepherds and
16,2611,"certain more negroid people from southern Persia, the Elamites,"
16,2612,who were the first nomads to come into close contact with the
16,2613,early civilizations.  They came {90} as traders and as raiders.
16,2614,"Finally there arose leaders among them with bolder imaginations,"
16,2615,and they became conquerors.
16,2625,"About 2750 B.C. a great Semitic leader, Sargon, had conquered the"
16,2626,whole Sumerian land and was master of all the world from the
16,2627,Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea.  He was an illiterate
16,2628,"barbarian and his people, the Akkadians, learnt the Sumerian"
16,2629,writing and adopted the Sumerian language as the speech of the
16,2630,officials and the learned.  The empire he founded decayed after
16,2631,"two centuries, and after one inundation of Elamites a fresh"
16,2632,"Semitic people, the Amorites, by degrees established their rule"
16,2633,over Sumeria.  They made their capital in what had hitherto been a
16,2634,"small up-river town, Babylon, and their empire is called the first"
16,2635,Babylonian Empire.  It was consolidated by a great king called
16,2636,Hammurabi (circa 2100 B.C.) who made the earliest code of laws yet
16,2637,known to history.
16,2639,The narrow valley of the Nile lies less open to nomadic invasion
16,2640,"than Mesopotamia, but about the time of Hammurabi occurred a"
16,2641,successful Semitic invasion of Egypt and a line of Pharaohs was
16,2642,"set up, the Hyksos or ""shepherd kings,"" which lasted for several"
16,2643,centuries.  These Semitic conquerors never assimilated themselves
16,2644,with the Egyptians; they were always regarded with hostility as
16,2645,foreigners and barbarians; and they were at last expelled by a
16,2646,popular uprising about 1600 B.C.
16,2648,"But the Semites had come into Sumeria for good and all, the two"
16,2649,races assimilated and the Babylonian Empire became Semitic in its
16,2650,language and character.
17,2662,The earliest boats and ships must have come into use some
17,2663,twenty-five or thirty thousand years ago.  Man was probably
17,2664,paddling about on the water with a log of wood or an inflated skin
17,2665,"to assist him, at latest in the beginnings of the Neolithic"
17,2666,period.  A basketwork boat covered with skin and caulked was used
17,2667,in Egypt and Sumeria from the beginnings of our knowledge.  Such
17,2668,boats are still used there.  They are used to this day in Ireland
17,2669,and Wales and in Alaska; sealskin boats still make the crossing of
17,2670,Behring Straits.  The hollow log followed as tools improved.  The
17,2671,building of boats and then ships came in a natural succession.
17,2673,Perhaps the legend of Noah's Ark preserves the memory of some
17,2674,"early exploit in shipbuilding, just as the story of the Flood, so"
17,2675,"widely distributed among the peoples of the world, may be the"
17,2676,tradition of the flooding of the Mediterranean basin.
17,2678,There were ships upon the Red Sea long before the pyramids were
17,2679,"built, and there were ships on the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf"
17,2680,"by 7000 B.C.  Mostly these were the ships of fishermen, but some"
17,2681,were already trading and pirate ships--for knowing what we do of
17,2682,mankind we may guess pretty safely that the first sailors
17,2683,plundered where they could and traded where they had to do so.
17,2685,The seas on which these first ships adventured were inland seas on
17,2686,which the wind blew fitfully and which were often at a dead calm
17,2687,"for days together, so that sailing did not develop beyond an"
17,2688,accessory use.  It is only in the last four hundred years that the
17,2689,"well-rigged, ocean-going, sailing ship has developed.  The ships"
17,2690,of the ancient world were essentially rowing ships which hugged
17,2691,the shore and went into harbour at the first sign of rough
17,2692,weather.  As ships grew into big galleys they caused a demand for
17,2693,war captives as galley slaves.
17,2695,We have already noted the appearance of the Semitic people as
17,2696,"wanderers and nomads in the region of Syria and Arabia, and how"
17,2697,they conquered Sumeria and set up first the Akkadian and then the
17,2698,first Babylonian Empire.  In the west these same Semitic peoples
17,2699,{92} were taking to the sea.  They set up a string of harbour
17,2700,"towns along the Eastern coast of the Mediterranean, of which Tyre"
17,2701,"and Sidon were the chief; and by the time of Hammurabi in Babylon,"
17,2702,"they had spread as traders, wanderers and colonizers over the"
17,2703,whole Mediterranean basin.  These sea Semites were called the
17,2704,"Phoenicians, They settled largely in Spain, pushing back the old"
17,2705,Iberian Basque population and sending coasting expeditions through
17,2706,the straits of Gibraltar; and they set up colonies upon the north
17,2707,"coast of Africa.  Of Carthage, one of these Phoenician cities, we"
17,2708,shall have much more to tell later.
17,2710,But the Phoenicians were not the first people to have galleys in
17,2711,the Mediterranean waters.  There was already a series of towns and
17,2712,cities among the islands and coasts of that sea belonging to a
17,2713,race or races apparently connected by blood and language with the
17,2714,"Basques to the west and the Berbers and Egyptians to the south,"
17,2715,the AEgean peoples.  These peoples must not be confused with the
17,2716,"Greeks, who come much later into our story; they were pre-Greek,"
17,2717,but they had cities in Greece and Asia Minor; Mycenae and Troy for
17,2718,"example, and they had a great and prosperous establishment at"
17,2719,Cnossos in Crete.
17,2721,It is only in the last half century that the industry of
17,2722,excavating archaeologists has brought the extent and civilization
17,2723,of the AEgean peoples to our knowledge.  Cnossos has been most
17,2724,thoroughly explored; it was happily not succeeded by any city big
17,2725,"enough to destroy its ruins, and so it is our chief source of"
17,2726,information about this once almost forgotten civilization.
17,2728,The history of Cnossos goes back as far as the history of Egypt;
17,2729,the two countries were trading actively across the sea by 4000
17,2730,"B.C.  By 2500 B.C., that is between the time of Sargon I and"
17,2731,"Hammurabi, Cretan civilization was at its zenith."
17,2733,Cnossos was not so much a town as a great palace for the Cretan
17,2734,monarch and his people.  It was not even fortified.  It was only
17,2735,"fortified later as the Phoenicians grew strong, and as a new and"
17,2736,"more terrible breed of pirates, the Greeks, came upon the sea from"
17,2737,the north.
17,2739,"The monarch was called Minos, as the Egyptian monarch was called"
17,2740,Pharaoh; and he kept his state in a palace fitted with running
17,2741,"water, with bathrooms and the like conveniences such as we know of"
17,2742,in no other ancient remains.  There he held great festivals and
17,2743,"shows.  There was bull-fighting, singularly like the"
17,2744,bull-fighting that {93} still survives in Spain; there was
17,2745,resemblance even in the costumes of the bull-fighters; and there
17,2746,were gymnastic displays.  The women's clothes were remarkably
17,2747,modern in spirit; they wore corsets and flounced dresses.  The
17,2748,"pottery, the textile manufactures, the sculpture, painting,"
17,2749,"jewellery, ivory, metal and inlay work of these {94} Cretans was"
17,2750,"often astonishingly beautiful.  And they had a system of writing,"
17,2751,but that still remains to be deciphered.
17,2755,This happy and sunny and civilized life lasted for some score of
17,2756,centuries.  About 2000 B.C. Cnossos and Babylon abounded in
17,2757,comfortable and cultivated people who probably led very pleasant
17,2758,"lives.  They had shows and they had religious festivals, they had"
17,2759,domestic slaves to look after them and industrial slaves to make a
17,2760,profit for them.  Life must have seemed very secure in Cnossos for
17,2761,"such people, sunlit and girdled by the blue sea.  Egypt of course"
17,2762,must have appeared rather a declining country in those days under
17,2763,"the rule of her half-barbaric shepherd kings, and if one took an"
17,2764,interest in politics one must have noticed how the Semitic people
17,2765,"seemed to be getting everywhere, ruling Egypt, ruling distant"
17,2766,"Babylon, building Nineveh on the upper Tigris, sailing west to the"
17,2767,Pillars of Hercules (the straits of Gibraltar) and setting up
17,2768,their colonies on those distant coasts.
17,2770,"There were some active arid curious minds in Cnossos, because"
17,2771,later on the Greeks told legends of a certain skilful Cretan
17,2772,"artificer, Daedalus, who attempted to make some sort of flying"
17,2773,"machine, perhaps a glider, which collapsed and fell into the sea."
17,2775,It is interesting to note some of the differences as well as the
17,2776,resemblances between the life of Cnossos and our own.  To a Cretan
17,2777,gentleman of 2500 B.C. iron was a rare metal which fell out of the
17,2778,sky and was curious rather than useful--for as yet only meteoric
17,2779,"iron was known, iron had not been obtained from its ores.  Compare"
17,2780,that with our modern state of affairs pervaded by iron everywhere.
17,2781,"The horse again would be a quite legendary creature to our Cretan,"
17,2782,a sort of super-ass which lived in the bleak northern lands far
17,2783,away beyond the Black Sea.  Civilization for him dwelt chiefly in
17,2784,"AEgean Greece and Asia Minor, where Lydians and Carians and Trojans"
17,2785,lived a life and probably spoke languages like his own.  There
17,2786,"were Phoenicians and AEgeans settled in Spain and North Africa, but"
17,2787,those were very remote regions to his imagination.  Italy was
17,2788,still a desolate land covered with dense forests; the
17,2789,brown-skinned Etruscans had not yet gone there from Asia Minor.  And
17,2790,one day perhaps this Cretan gentleman went down to the harbour and saw
17,2791,a captive who attracted his attention because he was very
17,2792,fair-complexioned {95} and had blue eyes.  Perhaps our Cretan tried to
17,2793,talk to him and was answered in an unintelligible gibberish.  This
17,2794,creature came from somewhere beyond the Black Sea and seemed to be
17,2795,an altogether benighted savage.  But indeed he was an Aryan
17,2796,"tribesman, of a race and culture of which we shall soon have much"
17,2797,"to tell, and the strange gibberish he spoke was to differentiate"
17,2798,"some day into Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, German, English and"
17,2799,most of the chief languages of the world.
17,2803,"Such was Cnossos at its zenith, intelligent, enterprising, bright"
17,2804,and happy.  But about 1400 B.C. disaster came perhaps very
17,2805,"suddenly upon its prosperity.  The palace of Minos was destroyed,"
17,2806,and its ruins have never been rebuilt or inhabited from that day
17,2807,to this.  We do not know how this disaster occurred.  The
17,2808,excavators note what appears to be scattered plunder and the marks
17,2809,of the fire.  But the traces of a very destructive earthquake have
17,2810,"also been found.  Nature alone may have destroyed Cnossos, or the"
17,2811,Greeks may have finished what the earthquake began.
18,2823,The Egyptians had never submitted very willingly to the rule of
18,2824,their Semitic shepherd kings and about 1600 A.D. a vigorous
18,2825,patriotic movement expelled these foreigners.  Followed a new
18,2826,"phase or revival for Egypt, a period known to Egyptologists as the"
18,2827,"New Empire.  Egypt, which had not been closely consolidated before"
18,2828,"the Hyksos invasion, was now a united country; and the phase of"
18,2829,subjugation and insurrection left her full of military spirit.
18,2830,The Pharaohs became aggressive conquerors.  They had now acquired
18,2831,"the war horse and the war chariot, which the Hyksos had brought to"
18,2832,them.  Under Thothmes III and Amenophis III Egypt had extended her
18,2833,rule into Asia as far as the Euphrates.
18,2835,We are entering now upon a thousand years of warfare between the
18,2836,once quite separated civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Nile.
18,2837,"At first Egypt was ascendant.  The great dynasties, the"
18,2838,"Seventeenth Dynasty, which included Thothmes III and Amenophis III"
18,2839,"and IV and a great queen Hatasu, and the Nineteenth, when Rameses"
18,2840,"II, supposed by some to have been the Pharaoh of Moses, reigned"
18,2841,"for sixty-seven years, raised Egypt to high levels of prosperity."
18,2842,"In between there were phases of depression for Egypt, conquest by"
18,2843,the Syrians and later conquest by the Ethiopians from the South.
18,2844,"In Mesopotamia Babylon ruled, then the Hittites and the Syrians of"
18,2845,Damascus rose to a transitory predominance; at one time the
18,2846,Syrians conquered Egypt; the fortunes of the Assyrians of Nineveh
18,2847,ebbed and flowed; sometimes the city was a conquered city;
18,2848,sometimes the Assyrians ruled in Babylon and assailed Egypt.  Our
18,2849,space is too limited here to tell of the comings and goings of the
18,2850,armies of the Egyptians and of the various Semitic powers of Asia
18,2851,"Minor, Syria and Mesopotamia.  They were armies now provided with"
18,2852,"vast droves of war chariots, for the horse--still used only for"
18,2853,{97} war and glory--had spread by this time into the old
18,2854,civilizations from Central Asia.
18,2858,Great conquerors appear in the dim light of that distant time and
18,2859,"pass, Tushratta, King of Mitanni, who captured Nineveh, Tiglath"
18,2860,Pileser I of Assyria who conquered Babylon.  At last the Assyrians
18,2861,became the greatest military power of the time. Tiglath Pileser
18,2862,III conquered Babylon in 745 B.C. and founded what historians call
18,2863,the New Assyrian Empire.  Iron had also come now into civilization
18,2864,"out of the north; the Hittites, the precursors of the Armenians,"
18,2865,"had it first and communicated its use to the Assyrians, and an"
18,2866,"Assyrian usurper, Sargon II, armed his troops with it.  Assyria"
18,2867,became the first power to expound the doctrine of blood and iron.
18,2868,"Sargon's son Sennacherib led an army to the borders of Egypt, and"
18,2869,was defeated not by military strength but by the plague.
18,2870,Sennacherib's grandson Assurbanipal (who is also known in history
18,2871,{98} by his Greek name of Sardanapalus) did actually conquer Egypt
18,2872,in 670 B.C.  But Egypt was already a conquered country then under
18,2873,an Ethiopian dynasty.  Sardanapalus simply replaced one conqueror
18,2874,by another.
18,2878,If one had a series of political maps of this long period of
18,2879,"history, this interval of ten centuries, we should have Egypt"
18,2880,"expanding and contracting like an amoeba under a microscope, and"
18,2881,"we should see these various Semitic states of the Babylonians, the"
18,2882,"Assyrians, the Hittites and the Syrians coming and going, eating"
18,2883,each other up and disgorging each other again.  To the west of
18,2884,"Asia Minor there would be little AEgean states like Lydia, whose"
18,2885,"capital was Sardis, and Caria.  But after about 1200 B.C. and"
18,2886,"perhaps earlier, a new set of names would come into the map of the"
18,2887,ancient world from {100} the north-east and from the north-west.
18,2888,"These would be the names of certain barbaric tribes, armed with"
18,2889,"iron weapons and using horse-chariots, who were becoming a great"
18,2890,affliction to the AEgean and Semitic civilizations on the northern
18,2891,borders.  They all spoke variants of what once must have been the
18,2892,"same language, Aryan."
18,2902,Round the north-east of the Black and Caspian Seas were coming the
18,2903,Medes and Persians.  Confused with these in the records of the
18,2904,time were Scythians and Samatians.  From north-east or
18,2905,"north-west came the Armenians, from the north-west of the"
18,2906,"sea-barrier through the Balkan peninsula came Cimmerians,"
18,2907,Phrygians and the Hellenic tribes whom now we call the Greeks.
18,2908,"They were raiders and robbers and plunderers of cities, these"
18,2909,"Ayrans, east and west alike.  They were all kindred and similar"
18,2910,"peoples, hardy herdsmen who had taken to plunder.  In the east"
18,2911,"they were still only borderers and raiders, but in the west they"
18,2912,were taking cities and driving out the civilized AEgean
18,2913,populations.  The AEgean peoples were so pressed that they were
18,2914,seeking new homes in lands beyond the Aryan range.  Some were
18,2915,seeking a settlement in the delta of the Nile and being repulsed
18,2916,"by the Egyptians; some, the Etruscans, seem to have sailed from"
18,2917,Asia Minor to found a state in the forest wildernesses of middle
18,2918,Italy; some built themselves cities upon the south-east coasts of
18,2919,the Mediterranean and became later that people known in history as
18,2920,the Philistines.
18,2922,Of these Aryans who came thus rudely upon the scene of the ancient
18,2923,civilizations we will tell more fully in a later section.  Here we
18,2924,note simply all this stir and emigration amidst the area of the
18,2925,"ancient civilizations, that was set up by the swirl of the gradual"
18,2926,and continuous advance of these Aryan barbarians out of the
18,2927,northern forests and wildernesses between 1600 and 600 B.C.
18,2929,And in a section to follow we must tell also of a little Semitic
18,2930,"people, the Hebrews, in the hills behind the Phoenician and"
18,2931,"Philistine coasts, who began to be of significance in the world"
18,2932,towards the end of this period.  They produced a literature of
18,2933,"very great importance in subsequent history, a collection of"
18,2934,"books, histories, poems, books of wisdom and prophetic works, the"
18,2935,Hebrew Bible.
18,2937,In Mesopotamia and Egypt the coming of the Aryans did not cause
18,2938,fundamental changes until after 600 B.C. The flight of {101} the
18,2939,AEgeans before the Greeks and even the destruction of Cnossos must
18,2940,have seemed a very remote disturbance to both the citizens of
18,2941,Egypt and of Babylon.  Dynasties came and went in these cradle
18,2942,"states of civilization, but the main tenor of human life went on,"
18,2943,with a slow increase in refinement and complexity age by age.  In
18,2944,Egypt the accumulated monuments of more ancient times--the
18,2945,pyramids were already in their third thousand of years and a show
18,2946,for visitors just as they are to-day--were supplemented by fresh
18,2947,"and splendid buildings, more particularly in the time of the"
18,2948,seventeenth and nineteenth dynasties.  The great temples at Karnak
18,2949,and Luxor date from this time.  All the chief monuments of
18,2950,"Nineveh, the great temples, the winged bulls with human heads, the"
18,2951,"reliefs of kings and chariots and lion hunts, were done in these"
18,2952,"centuries between 1600 and 600 B.C., and this period also covers"
18,2953,most of the splendours of Babylon.
18,2958,Both from Mesopotamia and Egypt we now have abundant public
18,2959,"records, business accounts, stories, poetry and private"
18,2960,"correspondence.  We know that life, for prosperous and influential"
18,2961,"people in such cities as Babylon and the Egyptian Thebes, was"
18,2962,already almost as refined and as luxurious as that of comfortable
18,2963,and prosperous people to-day.  Such people lived an orderly and
18,2964,ceremonious life in beautiful and beautifully furnished and
18,2965,"decorated houses, wore richly decorated clothing and lovely"
18,2966,"jewels; they had feasts and festivals, entertained one another"
18,2967,"with music and dancing, were waited upon by highly trained"
18,2968,"servants, were cared for by doctors and dentists.  They did not"
18,2969,"travel very much or very far, but boating {102} excursions were a"
18,2970,common summer pleasure both on the Nile and on the Euphrates.  The
18,2971,beast of burthen was the ass; the horse was still used only in
18,2972,chariots for war and upon occasions of state.  The mule was still
18,2973,"novel and the camel, though it was known in Mesopotamia, had not"
18,2974,been brought into Egypt.  And there were few utensils of iron;
18,2975,copper and bronze remained the prevailing metals.  Fine linen and
18,2976,cotton fabrics were known as well as wool.  But there was no silk
18,2977,"yet.  Glass was known and beautifully coloured, but glass things"
18,2978,were usually small.  There was no clear glass and no optical use
18,2979,of glass.  People had gold stoppings in their teeth but no
18,2980,spectacles on their noses.
18,2982,One odd contrast between the life of old Thebes or Babylon and
18,2983,modern life was the absence of coined money.  Most trade was still
18,2984,done by barter.  Babylon was financially far ahead of Egypt.  Gold
18,2985,and silver were used for exchange and kept in ingots; and there
18,2986,"were bankers, before coinage, who stamped their names and the"
18,2987,weight on these lumps of precious metal.  A merchant or traveller
18,2988,would carry precious stones to sell to pay for his necessities.
18,2989,Most servants and workers were slaves who were paid not money but
18,2990,in kind.  As money came in slavery declined.
18,2992,A modern visitor to these crowning cities of the ancient world
18,2993,would have missed two very important articles of diet; there were
18,2994,no hens and no eggs.  A French cook would have found small joy in
18,2995,Babylon.  These things came from the East somewhere about the time
18,2996,of the last Assyrian empire.
18,2998,Religion like everything else had undergone great refinement.
18,2999,Human sacrifice for instance had long since disappeared; animals
18,3000,or bread dummies had been substituted for the victim.  (But the
18,3001,"Phoenicians and especially the citizens of Carthage, their"
18,3002,"greatest settlement in Africa, were accused, later of immolating"
18,3003,human beings.)  When a great chief had died in the ancient days it
18,3004,had been customary to sacrifice his wives and slaves and break
18,3005,spear and bow at his tomb so that he should not go unattended and
18,3006,unarmed in the spirit world.  In Egypt there survived of this dark
18,3007,tradition the pleasant custom of burying small models of house and
18,3008,"shop and servants and cattle with the dead, models that give us"
18,3009,to-day the liveliest realization of the safe and cultivated life
18,3010,"of these ancient people, three thousand years and more ago."
18,3016,Such was the ancient world before the coming of the Aryans out of
18,3017,the northern forests and plains.  In India and China there were
18,3018,parallel developments.  In the great valleys of both these regions
18,3019,"agricultural city states of brownish peoples were growing up, but"
18,3020,in India they do not seem to have advanced or coalesced so rapidly
18,3021,as the city states of Mesopotamia or Egypt.  They were nearer the
18,3022,level of the ancient Sumerians or of the Maya civilization of
18,3023,America.  Chinese history has still to be modernized by Chinese
18,3024,scholars and cleared of much legendary matter.  Probably China at
18,3025,this time was in advance of India.  Contemporary with the
18,3026,"seventeenth dynasty in Egypt, there was a dynasty of emperors in"
18,3027,"China, the Shang dynasty, priest emperors over a loose-knit empire"
18,3028,of subordinate kings.  The chief duty of these early emperors was
18,3029,to perform the seasonal sacrifices.  Beautiful bronze vessels from
18,3030,"the time of the Shang dynasty still exist, and their beauty and"
18,3031,workmanship compel us to recognize that many centuries of
18,3032,civilization must have preceded their manufacture.
19,3044,"Four thousand years ago, that is to say about 2000 B.C., central"
19,3045,"and south-eastern Europe and central Asia were probably warmer,"
19,3046,moister and better wooded than they are now.  In these regions of
19,3047,the earth wandered a group of tribes mainly of the fair and
19,3048,"blue-eyed Nordic race, sufficiently in touch with one another to"
19,3049,speak merely variations of one common language from the Rhine to
19,3050,the Caspian Sea.  At that time they may not have been a very
19,3051,"numerous people, and their existence was unsuspected by the"
19,3052,"Babylonians to whom Hammurabi was giving laws, or by the already"
19,3053,ancient and cultivated land of Egypt which was tasting in those
19,3054,days for the first time the bitterness of foreign conquest.
19,3056,These Nordic people were destined to play a very important part
19,3057,indeed in the world's history.  They were a people of the
19,3058,parklands and the forest clearings; they had no horses at first
19,3059,but they had cattle; when they wandered they put their tents and
19,3060,other gear on rough ox waggons; when they settled for a time they
19,3061,may have made huts of wattle and mud.  They burnt their important
19,3062,dead; they did not bury them ceremoniously as the brunette peoples
19,3063,did.  They put the ashes of their greater leaders in urns and then
19,3064,made a great circular mound about them.  These mounds are the
19,3065,"""round barrows"" that occur all over north Europe.  The brunette"
19,3066,"people, their predecessors, did not burn their dead but buried"
19,3067,"them in a sitting position in elongated mounds; the ""long"
19,3068,"barrows."""
19,3070,"The Aryans raised crops of wheat, ploughing with oxen, but they"
19,3071,did not settle down by their crops; they would reap and move on.
19,3072,"They had bronze, and somewhen about 1500 B.C. they acquired iron."
19,3073,They may have been the discoverers of iron smelting.  And somewhen
19,3074,vaguely about that time they also got the horse--which to begin
19,3075,with they used only for draught purposes.  Their social life did
19,3076,not centre upon a temple like that of the more settled people
19,3077,"round the Mediterranean, and their chief men were leaders rather"
19,3078,than priests.  They had an aristocratic social order rather than a
19,3079,{106} divine and regal order; from a very early stage they
19,3080,distinguished certain families as leaderly and noble.
19,3090,They were a very vocal people.  They enlivened their wanderings by
19,3091,"feasts, at which there was much drunkenness and at which a special"
19,3092,"sort of man, the bards, would sing and recite.  They had no"
19,3093,"writing until they had come into contact with civilization, and"
19,3094,the memories of these bards were their living literature.  This
19,3095,use of recited language as an entertainment did much to make it a
19,3096,"fine and beautiful instrument of expression, and to that no doubt"
19,3097,the subsequent predominance of the languages derived from Aryan
19,3098,"is, in part, to be ascribed.  Every Aryan people had its legendary"
19,3099,"history crystallized in bardic recitations, epics, sagas and"
19,3100,"vedas, as they were variously called."
19,3102,The social life of these people centred about the households of
19,3103,their leading men.  The hall of the chief where they settled for a
19,3104,time was often a very capacious timber building.  There were no
19,3105,doubt huts for herds and outlying farm buildings; but with most of
19,3106,"the Aryan peoples this hall was the general centre, everyone went"
19,3107,there to feast and hear the bards and take part in games and
19,3108,discussions.  Cowsheds and stabling surrounded it.  The chief and
19,3109,his wife and so forth would sleep on a dais or in an upper
19,3110,"gallery; the commoner sort slept about anywhere, as people still"
19,3111,"do in Indian households.  Except for weapons, ornaments, tools and"
19,3112,suchlike personal possessions there was a sort of patriarchal
19,3113,communism in the tribe.  The chief owned the cattle and grazing
19,3114,lands in the common interest; forest and rivers were the wild.
19,3116,This was the fashion of the people who were increasing and
19,3117,multiplying over the great spaces of central Europe and west
19,3118,central Asia during the growth of the great civilization of
19,3119,"Mesopotamia and the Nile, and whom we find pressing upon the"
19,3120,heliolithic peoples everywhere in the second millennium before
19,3121,Christ.  They were coming into France and Britain and into Spain.
19,3122,They pushed westward in two waves.  The first of these people who
19,3123,reached Britain and Ireland were armed with bronze weapons.  They
19,3124,exterminated or subjugated the people who had made the great stone
19,3125,monuments of Carnac in Brittany and Stonehenge and Avebury in
19,3126,England.  They reached Ireland. They are called the Goidelic
19,3127,"Celts.  The {107} second wave of a closely kindred people, perhaps"
19,3128,"intermixed with other racial elements, brought iron with it into"
19,3129,"Great Britain, and is known as the wave of Brythonic Celts.  From"
19,3130,them the Welsh derive their language.
19,3134,Kindred Celtic peoples were pressing southward into Spain and
19,3135,coming into contact not only with the heliolithic Basque people
19,3136,who still occupied the country but with the Semitic Phoenician
19,3137,"colonies of the sea coast.  A closely allied series of tribes, the"
19,3138,"Italians, were making their way down the still wild and wooded"
19,3139,Italian peninsula.  They did not always conquer.  In the eighth
19,3140,"century B.C. Rome appears in history, a trading town on the Tiber,"
19,3141,inhabited by Aryan Latins but under the rule of Etruscan nobles
19,3142,and kings.
19,3144,At the other extremity of the Aryan range there was a similar
19,3145,"progress southward of similar tribes.  Aryan peoples, speaking"
19,3146,"Sanskrit, had come down through the western passes into North"
19,3147,{108} India long before 1000 B.C.  There they came into contact
19,3148,"with a primordial brunette civilization, the Dravidian"
19,3149,"civilization, and learnt much from it.  Other Aryan tribes seem to"
19,3150,have spread over the mountain masses of Central Asia far to the
19,3151,east of the present range of such peoples.  In Eastern Turkestan
19,3152,"there are still fair, blue-eyed Nordic tribes, but now they speak"
19,3153,Mongolian tongues.
19,3155,Between the Black and Caspian Seas the ancient Hittites had been
19,3156,"submerged and ""Aryanized"" by the Armenians before 1000 B.C., and"
19,3157,the Assyrians and Babylonians were already aware of a new and
19,3158,"formidable fighting barbarism on the north-eastern frontiers, a"
19,3159,"group of tribes amidst which the Scythians, the Medes and the"
19,3160,Persians remain as outstanding names.
19,3162,But it was through the Balkan peninsula that Aryan tribes made
19,3163,their first heavy thrust into the heart of the old-world
19,3164,civilization.  They were already coming southward and crossing
19,3165,into Asia Minor many centuries before 1000 B.C.  First came a
19,3166,"group of tribes of whom the Phrygians were the most conspicuous,"
19,3167,"and then in succession the AEolic, the Ionic and the Dorian Greeks."
19,3168,By 1000 B.C. they had wiped out the ancient AEgean civilization
19,3169,both in the mainland of Greece and in most of the Greek islands;
19,3170,the cities of Mycenae and Tiryns were obliterated and Cnossos was
19,3171,nearly forgotten.  The Greeks had taken to the sea before 1000
19,3172,"A.D., they had settled in Crete and Rhodes, and they were founding"
19,3173,colonies in Sicily and the south of Italy after the fashion of the
19,3174,Phoenician trading cities that were dotted along the Mediterranean
19,3175,coasts.
19,3177,"So it was, while Tiglath Pileser III and Sargon II and"
19,3178,Sardanapalus were ruling in Assyria and fighting with Babylonia
19,3179,"and Syria and Egypt, the Aryan peoples were learning the methods"
19,3180,of civilization and making it over for their own purposes in Italy
19,3181,and Greece and north Persia.  The theme of history from the ninth
19,3182,century B.C. onward for six centuries is the story of how these
19,3183,Aryan peoples grew to power and enterprise and how at last they
19,3184,"subjugated the whole Ancient World, Semitic, AEgean and Egyptian"
19,3185,alike.  In form the Aryan peoples were altogether victorious; but
19,3186,"the struggle of Aryan, Semitic and Egyptian ideas and methods was"
19,3187,continued long after the sceptre was in Aryan hands.  It is indeed
19,3188,a struggle that goes on through all the rest of history and still
19,3189,in a manner continues to this day.
20,3201,We have already mentioned how Assyria became a great military
20,3202,power under Tiglath Pileser III and under the usurper Sargon II.
20,3203,Sargon was not this man's original name; he adopted it to flatter
20,3204,the conquered Babylonians by reminding them of that ancient
20,3205,"founder of the Akkadian Empire, Sargon I, two thousand years"
20,3206,"before his time.  Babylon, for all that it was a conquered city,"
20,3207,"was of greater population and importance than Nineveh, and its"
20,3208,great god Bel Marduk and its traders and priests had to be treated
20,3209,politely.  In Mesopotamia in the eighth century B.C. we are
20,3210,already far beyond the barbaric days when the capture of a town
20,3211,meant loot and massacre.  Conquerors sought to propitiate and win
20,3212,the conquered.  For a century and a half after Sargon the new
20,3213,"Assyrian empire endured and, as we have noted, Assurbanipal"
20,3214,(Sardanapalus) held at least lower Egypt.
20,3216,But the power and solidarity of Assyria waned rapidly.  Egypt by
20,3217,"an effort threw off the foreigner under a Pharoah Psammetichus I,"
20,3218,and under Necho II attempted a war of conquest in Syria.  By that
20,3219,"time Assyria was grappling with foes nearer at hand, and could"
20,3220,make but a poor resistance.  A Semitic people from south-east
20,3221,"Mesopotamia, the Chaldeans, combined with Aryan Medes and Persians"
20,3222,"from the north-east against Nineveh, and in"
20,3223,606 B.C.--for now we are coming down to exact chronology--took
20,3224,that city.
20,3226,There was a division of the spoils of Assyria.  A Median Empire
20,3227,"was set up in the north under Cyaxares.   It included Nineveh, and"
20,3228,its capital was Ecbatana.  Eastward it reached to the borders of
20,3229,India.  To the south of this in a great crescent was a new
20,3230,"Chaldean Empire, the Second Babylonian Empire, which rose to a"
20,3231,very great degree of wealth and power under the rule of
20,3232,Nebuchadnezzar the Great (the Nebuchadnezzar of the Bible). The
20,3233,"last great days, the {110} greatest days of all, for Babylon"
20,3234,"began.  For a time the two Empires remained at peace, and the"
20,3235,daughter of Nebuchadnezzar was married to Cyaxares.
20,3237,Meanwhile Necho II was pursuing his easy conquests in Syria.  He
20,3238,"had defeated and slain King Josiah of Judah, a small country of"
20,3239,"which there is more to tell presently, at the battle of Megiddo in"
20,3240,"608 B.C., and he pushed on to the Euphrates to encounter not a"
20,3241,decadent Assyria but a renascent Babylonia.  The Chaldeans dealt
20,3242,very vigorously with the Egyptians.  Necho was routed and driven
20,3243,"back to Egypt, and the Babylonian frontier pushed down to the"
20,3244,ancient Egyptian boundaries.
20,3246,From 606 until 589 B.C. the Second Babylonian Empire flourished
20,3247,insecurely.  It flourished so long as it kept the peace with the
20,3248,"stronger, hardier Median Empire to the north.  And during these"
20,3249,sixty-seven years not only life but learning flourished in the
20,3250,ancient city.
20,3258,Even under the Assyrian monarchs and especially under
20,3259,"Sardanapalus, Babylon had been a scene of great intellectual"
20,3260,"activity.  {111} Sardanapalus, though an Assyrian, had been quite"
20,3261,"Babylon-ized.  He made a library, a library not of paper but of"
20,3262,the clay tablets that were used for writing in Mesopotamia since
20,3263,early Sumerian days.  His collection has been unearthed and is
20,3264,perhaps the most precious store of historical material in the
20,3265,"world.  The last of the Chaldean line of Babylonian monarchs,"
20,3266,"Nabonidus, had even keener literary tastes.  He patronized"
20,3267,"antiquarian researches, and when a date was worked out by his"
20,3268,investigators for the accession of Sargon I he commemorated the
20,3269,fact by inscriptions.  But there were many signs of disunion in
20,3270,"his empire, and he sought to centralize it by bringing a number of"
20,3271,the various local gods to Babylon and setting up temples to them
20,3272,there.  This device was to be practised quite successfully by the
20,3273,"Romans in later times, but in Babylon it roused the jealousy of"
20,3274,"the powerful priesthood of Bel Marduk, the dominant god of the"
20,3275,Babylonians.  They cast about for a possible alternative to
20,3276,"Nabonidus and found it in Cyrus the Persian, the ruler of the"
20,3277,adjacent Median Empire.  Cyrus had already distinguished himself
20,3278,"by conquering Croesus, the rich king of Lydia in Eastern Asia"
20,3279,"Minor.  {112} He came up against Babylon, there was a battle"
20,3280,"outside the walls, and the gates of the city were opened to him"
20,3281,(538 B.C.).  His soldiers entered the city without fighting.  The
20,3282,"crown prince Belshazzar, the son of Nabonidus, was feasting, the"
20,3283,"Bible relates, when a hand appeared and wrote in letters of fire"
20,3284,"upon the wall these mystical words: _""Mene, Mene, Tekel,"
20,3285,"Upharsin,""_ which was interpreted by the prophet Daniel, whom he"
20,3286,"summoned to read the riddle, as ""God has numbered thy kingdom and"
20,3287,finished it; thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting and
20,3288,"thy kingdom is given to the Medes and Persians.""  Possibly the"
20,3289,priests of Bel Marduk knew something about that writing on the
20,3290,"wall.  Belshazzar was killed that night, says the Bible."
20,3291,"Nabonidus was taken prisoner, and the occupation of the city was"
20,3292,so peaceful that the services of Bel Marduk continued without
20,3293,intermission.
20,3297,Thus it was the Babylonian and Median empires were united.
20,3298,"Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, subjugated Egypt.  Cambyses went mad"
20,3299,"and was accidentally killed, and was presently succeeded by Darius"
20,3300,"the Mede, Darius I, the son of Hystaspes, one of the chief"
20,3301,councillors of Cyrus.
20,3313,"The Persian Empire of Darius I, the first of the new Aryan empires"
20,3314,"in the seat of the old civilizations, was the greatest empire the"
20,3315,"world had hitherto seen.  It included all Asia Minor and Syria,"
20,3316,"all the old Assyrian and Babylonian empires, Egypt, the Caucasus"
20,3317,"and Caspian regions, Media, Persia, and it extended into India as"
20,3318,far as the Indus.  Such an empire was possible because the horse
20,3319,and rider and the chariot and the made-road had now been brought
20,3320,into the world.  Hitherto the ass and ox and the camel for desert
20,3321,use had afforded the swiftest method of {114} transport.  Great
20,3322,arterial roads were made by the Persian rulers to hold their new
20,3323,"empire, and post horses were always in waiting for the imperial"
20,3324,messenger or the traveller with an official permit.  Moreover the
20,3325,"world was now beginning to use coined money, which greatly"
20,3326,facilitated trade and intercourse.  But the capital of this vast
20,3327,empire was no longer Babylon.  In the long run the priesthood of
20,3328,Bel Marduk gained nothing by their treason.  Babylon though still
20,3329,"important was now a declining city, and the great cities of the"
20,3330,new empire were Persepolis and Susa and Ecbatana.  The capital was
20,3331,Susa.  Nineveh was already abandoned and sinking into ruins.
21,3343,"And now we can tell of the Hebrews, a Semitic people, not so"
21,3344,important in their own time as in their influence upon the later
21,3345,history of the world.  They were settled in Judea long before 1000
21,3346,"B.C., and their capital city after that time was Jerusalem.  Their"
21,3347,story is interwoven with that of the great empires on either side
21,3348,"of them, Egypt to the south and the changing empires of Syria,"
21,3349,Assyria and Babylon to the north.  Their country was an inevitable
21,3350,high road between these latter powers and Egypt.
21,3352,Their importance in the world is due to the fact that they
21,3353,"produced a written literature, a world history, a collection of"
21,3354,"laws, chronicles, psalms, books of wisdom, poetry and fiction and"
21,3355,political utterances which became at last what Christians know as
21,3356,"the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible.  This literature appears in"
21,3357,history in the fourth or fifth century B.C.
21,3359,Probably this literature was first put together in Babylon.  We
21,3360,"have already told how the Pharaoh, Necho II, invaded the Assyrian"
21,3361,"Empire while Assyria was fighting for life against Medes, Persians"
21,3362,"and Chaldeans.  Josiah King of Judah opposed him, and was defeated"
21,3363,and slain at Megiddo (608 B.C.).  Judah became a tributary to
21,3364,"Egypt, and when Nebuchadnezzar the Great, the new Chaldean king in"
21,3365,"Babylon, rolled back Necho into Egypt, he attempted to manage"
21,3366,Judah by setting up puppet kings in Jerusalem.  The experiment
21,3367,"failed, the people massacred his Babylonian officials, and he then"
21,3368,"determined to break up this little state altogether, which had"
21,3369,long been playing off Egypt against the northern empire.
21,3370,"Jerusalem was sacked and burnt, and the remnant of the people was"
21,3371,carried off captive to Babylon.
21,3375,There they remained until Cyrus took Babylon (538 B.C.).  He then
21,3376,collected them together and sent them back to resettle their
21,3377,country and rebuild the walls and temple of Jerusalem.
21,3379,Before that time the Jews do not seem to have been a very
21,3380,civilized or united people.  Probably only a very few of them
21,3381,could read or write.  In their own history one never hears of the
21,3382,early books of the Bible being read; the first mention of a book
21,3383,is in the time of Josiah.  The Babylonian captivity civilized them
21,3384,and consolidated them.  They returned aware of their own
21,3385,"literature, an acutely self-conscious and political people."
21,3387,Their Bible at that time seems to have consisted only of the
21,3388,"Pentateuch, that is to say the first five books of the Old"
21,3389,"Testament as we know it.  In addition, as separate books they"
21,3390,already had many of the other books that have since been
21,3391,"incorporated with the Pentateuch into the present Hebrew Bible,"
21,3392,"Chronicles, the Psalms and Proverbs for example."
21,3394,"The accounts of the Creation of the World, of Adam and Eve and of"
21,3395,"the Flood, with which the Bible begins, run closely parallel with"
21,3396,similar Babylonian legends; they seem to have been part of the
21,3397,common beliefs of all the Semitic peoples. So too the stories of
21,3398,Moses and of Samson have Sumerian and Babylonian parallels.  But
21,3399,with the story of Abraham and onward begins something more special
21,3400,to the Jewish race.
21,3402,Abraham may have lived as early as the days of Hammurabi in
21,3403,Babylon.  He was a patriarchal Semitic nomad.  To the book of
21,3404,Genesis the reader must go for the story of his wanderings and for
21,3405,the stories of his sons and grandchildren and how they became
21,3406,"captive in the Land of Egypt.  He travelled through Canaan, and"
21,3407,"the God of Abraham, says the Bible story, promised this smiling"
21,3408,land of prosperous cities to him and to his children.
21,3410,And after a long sojourn in Egypt and after fifty years of
21,3411,"wandering in the wilderness under the leadership of Moses, the"
21,3412,"children of Abraham, grown now to a host of twelve tribes, invaded"
21,3413,the land of Canaan from the Arabian deserts to the East.  They may
21,3414,have done this somewhen between 1600 B.C. and 1300 B.C.; there are
21,3415,no Egyptian records of Moses nor of Canaan at this time to help
21,3416,out the story.  But at any rate they did not succeed in conquering
21,3417,any {117} more than the hilly backgrounds of the promised land.
21,3418,"The coast was now in the hands, not of the Canaanites but of"
21,3419,"newcomers, those AEgean peoples, the Philistines; and their cities,"
21,3420,"Gaza, Gath, Ashdod, Ascalon and Joppa successfully withstood the"
21,3421,Hebrew attack.  For many generations the children of Abraham
21,3422,remained an obscure people of the hilly back country engaged in
21,3423,incessant bickerings with the Philistines and with the kindred
21,3424,"tribes about them, the Moabites, the Midianites and so forth.  The"
21,3425,reader will find in the book of Judges a record of their struggles
21,3426,and disasters during this period.  For very largely it is a record
21,3427,of disasters and failures frankly told.
21,3433,"For most of this period the Hebrews were ruled, so far as there"
21,3434,"was any rule among them, by priestly judges selected by the elders"
21,3435,"of the people, but at last somewhen towards 1000 B.C. they chose"
21,3436,"themselves a king, Saul, to lead them in battle.  But Saul's"
21,3437,leading was no great improvement upon the leading of the Judges;
21,3438,he perished under the hail of Philistine arrows at the battle of
21,3439,"Mount Gilboa, his armour went into the temple of the Philistine"
21,3440,"Venus, and his body was nailed to the walls of"
21,3441,Beth-shan.
21,3445,His successor David was more successful and more politic.  With
21,3446,David dawned the only period of prosperity the Hebrew peoples were
21,3447,ever to know.  It was based on a close alliance with the
21,3448,"Phoenician city of Tyre, whose King Hiram seems to have been a man"
21,3449,of very great intelligence and enterprise.  He wished to secure a
21,3450,trade route to the Red Sea through the Hebrew hill country.
21,3451,"Normally Phoenician trade went to the Red Sea by Egypt, but Egypt"
21,3452,was in a state of profound disorder at this {119} time; there may
21,3453,"have been other obstructions to Phoenician trade along this line,"
21,3454,and at any rate Hiram established the very closest relations both
21,3455,with David and with his son and successor Solomon.  Under Hiram's
21,3456,"auspices the walls, palace and temple of Jerusalem arose, and in"
21,3457,return Hiram built and launched his ships on the Red Sea.  A very
21,3458,considerable trade passed northward and southward through
21,3459,Jerusalem.  And Solomon achieved a prosperity and magnificence
21,3460,unprecedented in the experience of his people.  He was even given
21,3461,a daughter of Pharaoh in marriage.
21,3463,But it is well to keep the proportion of things in mind.  At the
21,3464,climax of his glories Solomon was only a little subordinate king
21,3465,in a little city.  His power was so transitory that within a few
21,3466,"years of his death, Shishak the first Pharaoh of the twenty-second"
21,3467,"dynasty, had taken Jerusalem and looted most of its splendours."
21,3468,The account of Solomon's magnificence given in the books of Kings
21,3469,and Chronicles is questioned by many critics.  They say that it
21,3470,was added to and exaggerated by the patriotic pride of later
21,3471,writers.  But the Bible account read carefully is not so
21,3472,overwhelming as it appears at the first reading.  Solomon's
21,3473,"temple, if one works out the measurements, would go inside a small"
21,3474,"suburban church, and his fourteen hundred chariots cease to"
21,3475,impress us when we learn from an Assyrian monument that his
21,3476,successor Ahab sent a contingent of two thousand to the Assyrian
21,3477,army.  It is also plainly manifest from the Bible narrative that
21,3478,Solomon spent himself in display and overtaxed and overworked his
21,3479,people.  At his death the northern part of his kingdom broke off
21,3480,from Jerusalem and became the independent kingdom of Israel.
21,3481,Jerusalem remained the capital city of Judah.
21,3483,"The prosperity of the Hebrew people was short-lived.  Hiram died,"
21,3484,and the help of Tyre ceased to strengthen Jerusalem.  Egypt grew
21,3485,strong again.  The history of the kings of Israel and the kings of
21,3486,"Judah becomes a history of two little states ground between,"
21,3487,"first, Syria, then Assyria and then Babylon to the north and Egypt"
21,3488,to the south.  It is a tale of disasters and of deliverances that
21,3489,only delayed disaster.  It is a tale of barbaric kings ruling a
21,3490,barbaric people. In 721 B.C. the kingdom of Israel was swept away
21,3491,into captivity by the Assyrians and its people utterly lost to
21,3492,"history.  Judah struggled {121} on until in 604 B.C., as we have"
21,3493,"told, it shared the fate of Israel.  There may be details open to"
21,3494,criticism in the Bible story of Hebrew history from the days of
21,3495,"the Judges onward, but on the whole it is evidently a true story"
21,3496,which squares with all that has been learnt in the excavation of
21,3497,Egypt and Assyria and Babylon during the past century.
21,3507,It was in Babylon that the Hebrew people got their history
21,3508,together and evolved their tradition.  The people who came back to
21,3509,Jerusalem at the command of Cyrus were a very different people in
21,3510,spirit and knowledge from those who had gone into captivity.  They
21,3511,had learnt civilization.  In the development of their peculiar
21,3512,"character a very great part was played by certain men, a new sort"
21,3513,"of men, the Prophets, to whom we must now direct our attention."
21,3514,These Prophets mark the appearance of new and remarkable forces in
21,3515,the steady development of human society.
22,3527,The fall of Assyria and Babylon were only the first of a series of
22,3528,disasters that were to happen to the Semitic peoples.  In the
22,3529,seventh century B.C. it would have seemed as though the whole
22,3530,civilized world was to be dominated by Semitic rulers.  They ruled
22,3531,"the great Assyrian empire and they had conquered Egypt; Assyria,"
22,3532,"Babylon, Syria were all Semitic, speaking languages that were"
22,3533,mutually intelligible.  The trade of the world was in Semitic
22,3534,"hands.  Tyre, Sidon, the great mother cities of the Phoenician"
22,3535,"coast, had thrown out colonies that grew at last to even greater"
22,3536,"proportion in Spain, Sicily and Africa.  Carthage, founded before"
22,3537,"800 B.C., had risen to a population of more than a million.  It"
22,3538,was for a time the greatest city on earth.  Its ships went to
22,3539,Britain and out into the Atlantic.  They may have reached Madeira.
22,3540,We have already noted how Hiram co-operated with Solomon to build
22,3541,ships on the Red Sea for the Arabian and perhaps for the Indian
22,3542,"trade.  In the time of the Pharaoh Necho, a Phoenician expedition"
22,3543,sailed completely round Africa.
22,3545,At that time the Aryan peoples were still barbarians.  Only the
22,3546,Greeks were reconstructing a new civilization of the ruins of the
22,3547,"one they had destroyed, and the Medes were becoming ""formidable,"""
22,3548,"as an Assyrian inscription calls them, in central Asia.  In 800"
22,3549,B.C. no one could have prophesied that before the third century
22,3550,B.C. every trace of Semitic dominion would be wiped out by
22,3551,"Aryan-speaking conquerors, and that everywhere the Semitic peoples"
22,3552,would be subjects or tributaries or scattered altogether.
22,3553,"Everywhere except in the northern deserts of Arabia, where the"
22,3554,"Bedouin adhered steadily to the nomadic way of life, the ancient"
22,3555,way of life of the Semites before Sargon I and his Akkadians went
22,3556,down to conquer Sumeria.  But the Arab Bedouin were never
22,3557,conquered by Aryan masters.
22,3561,Now of all these civilized Semites who were beaten and overrun in
22,3562,these five eventful centuries one people only held together and
22,3563,"clung to its ancient traditions and that was this little people,"
22,3564,"the Jews, who were sent back to build their city of Jerusalem by"
22,3565,"Cyrus the Persian.  And they were able to do this, because they"
22,3566,"had got together this literature of theirs, their Bible, in"
22,3567,Babylon.  It is not so much the Jews who made the Bible as the
22,3568,Bible which made the Jews.  Running through this Bible were
22,3569,"certain ideas, different from the ideas of the people about them,"
22,3570,"very stimulating and sustaining ideas, to which they were destined"
22,3571,"to cling through five and twenty centuries of hardship, adventure"
22,3572,and oppression.
22,3574,"Foremost of these Jewish ideas was this, that their God was"
22,3575,"invisible and remote, an invisible God in a temple not made with"
22,3576,"hands, a Lord of Righteousness throughout the earth.  All other"
22,3577,peoples had national gods embodied in images that lived in
22,3578,"temples.  If the image was smashed and the temple razed, presently"
22,3579,"that god died out.  But this was a new idea, this God of the Jews,"
22,3580,"in the heavens, high above priests and sacrifices.  And this God"
22,3581,"of Abraham, the Jews believed, had chosen them to be his peculiar"
22,3582,"people, to restore Jerusalem and make it the capital of"
22,3583,Righteousness in the World.  They were a people exalted by their
22,3584,sense of a common destiny.  This belief saturated them all when
22,3585,they returned to Jerusalem after the captivity in Babylon.
22,3587,Is it any miracle that in their days of overthrow and subjugation
22,3588,many Babylonians and Syrians and so forth and later on many
22,3589,"Phoenicians, speaking practically the same language and having"
22,3590,"endless customs, habits, tastes and traditions in common, should"
22,3591,be attracted by this inspiring cult and should seek to share in
22,3592,"its fellowship and its promise?  After the fall of Tyre, Sidon,"
22,3593,"Carthage and the Spanish Phoenician cities, the Phoenicians"
22,3594,"suddenly vanish from history; and as suddenly we find, not simply"
22,3595,"in Jerusalem but in Spain, Africa, Egypt, Arabia, the East,"
22,3596,"wherever the Phoenicians had set their feet, communities of Jews."
22,3597,And they were all held together by the Bible and by the reading of
22,3598,the Bible.  Jerusalem was from the first only their nominal
22,3599,capital; their real city was this book of books.  This is a new
22,3600,sort of thing in history.  It is something of which the seeds were
22,3601,"sown long before, when the Sumerians {124} and Egyptians began to"
22,3602,"turn their hieroglyphics into writing.  The Jews were a new thing,"
22,3603,a people without a king and presently without a temple (for as we
22,3604,"shall tell Jerusalem itself was broken up in 70 A.D.), held"
22,3605,together and consolidated out of heterogeneous elements by nothing
22,3606,but the power of the written word.
22,3608,And this mental welding of the Jews was neither planned nor
22,3609,foreseen nor done by either priests or statesmen.  Not only a new
22,3610,kind of community but a new kind of man comes into history with
22,3611,the development of the Jews.  In the days of Solomon the Hebrews
22,3612,looked like becoming a little people just like any other little
22,3613,"people of that time clustering around court and temple, ruled by"
22,3614,the wisdom of the priest and led by the ambition of the king.  But
22,3615,"already, the reader may learn from the Bible, this new sort of man"
22,3616,"of which we speak, the Prophet, was in evidence."
22,3623,What were these Prophets?  They were men of the most diverse
22,3624,origins.  The Prophet Ezekiel was of the priestly caste and the
22,3625,"Prophet Amos wore the goatskin mantle of a shepherd, but all had"
22,3626,"this in common, that they gave allegiance to no one but to the God"
22,3627,of Righteousness and that they spoke directly to the people.  They
22,3628,"{125} came without licence or consecration.  ""Now the word of the"
22,3629,"Lord came unto me;"" that was the formula.  They were intensely"
22,3630,"political.  They exhorted the people against Egypt, ""that broken"
22,3631,"reed,"" or against Assyria or Babylon; they denounced the indolence"
22,3632,of the priestly order or the flagrant sins of the King.  Some of
22,3633,"them turned their attention to what we should now call ""social"
22,3634,"reform.""  The rich were ""grinding the faces of the poor,"" the"
22,3635,luxurious were consuming the children's bread; wealthy people made
22,3636,friends with and imitated the splendours and vices of foreigners;
22,3637,"and this was hateful to Jehovah, the God of Abraham, who would"
22,3638,certainly punish this land.
22,3642,These fulminations were written down and preserved and studied.
22,3643,"They went wherever the Jews went, and wherever they went they"
22,3644,spread a new religious spirit.  They carried the common man past
22,3645,"priest and temple, past court and king and brought him face to"
22,3646,face with the Rule of Righteousness.  That is their supreme
22,3647,importance in the history of mankind.  In the great utterances of
22,3648,Isaiah the prophetic voice rises to a pitch of splendid
22,3649,anticipation and foreshadows the whole earth united and at peace
22,3650,under one God.  Therein the Jewish prophecies culminate.
22,3652,"All the Prophets did not speak in this fashion, and the"
22,3653,intelligent reader of the prophetic books will find much hate in
22,3654,"them, much prejudice, and much that will remind him of the"
22,3655,propaganda pamphlets {126}of the present time.  Nevertheless it is
22,3656,the Hebrew Prophets of the period round and about the Babylonian
22,3657,"captivity who mark the appearance of a new power in the world, the"
22,3658,"power of individual moral appeal, of an appeal to the free"
22,3659,conscience of mankind against the fetish sacrifices and slavish
22,3660,loyalties that had hitherto bridled and harnessed our race.
23,3672,Now while after Solomon (whose reign was probably about 960 B.C.)
23,3673,the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah were suffering
23,3674,"destruction and deportation, and while the Jewish people were"
23,3675,"developing their tradition in captivity in Babylon, another great"
23,3676,"power over the human mind, the Greek tradition, was also arising."
23,3677,While the Hebrew prophets were working out a new sense of direct
23,3678,moral responsibility between the people and an eternal and
23,3679,"universal God of Right, the Greek philosophers were training the"
23,3680,human mind in a new method and spirit of intellectual adventure.
23,3682,The Greek tribes as we have told were a branch of the
23,3683,Aryan-speaking stem. They had come down among the AEgean cities and
23,3684,islands some centuries before 1000 B.C.  They were probably
23,3685,already in southward movement before the Pharaoh Thothmes hunted
23,3686,his first elephants beyond the conquered Euphrates.  For in those
23,3687,days there were elephants in Mesopotamia and lions in Greece.
23,3689,"It is possible that it was a Greek raid that burnt Cnossos, but"
23,3690,there are no Greek legends of such a victory though there are
23,3691,stories of Minos and his palace (the Labyrinth) and of the skill
23,3692,of the Cretan artificers.
23,3702,Like most of the Aryans these Greeks had singers and reciters
23,3703,"whose performances were an important social link, and these handed"
23,3704,"down from the barbaric beginnings of their people two great epics,"
23,3705,"the _Iliad_, telling how a league of Greek tribes besieged and"
23,3706,"took and sacked the town of Troy in Asia Minor, and the _Odyssey_,"
23,3707,"being a long adventure story of the return of the sage captain,"
23,3708,"Odysseus, from Troy to his own island.  These epics were written"
23,3709,"down somewhen in the eighth or seventh century B.C., when the"
23,3710,Greeks had acquired the use of an alphabet from their more
23,3711,"civilized neighbours, but they {129} are supposed to have been in"
23,3712,existence very much earlier.  Formerly they were ascribed to a
23,3713,"particular blind bard, Homer, who was supposed to have sat down"
23,3714,and composed them as Milton composed Paradise Lost.  Whether there
23,3715,"really was such a poet, whether he composed or only wrote down and"
23,3716,"polished these epics and so forth, is a favourite quarrelling"
23,3717,ground for the erudite.  We need not concern ourselves with such
23,3718,bickerings here.  The thing that matters from our point of view is
23,3719,that the Greeks were in possession of their epics in the eighth
23,3720,"century B.C., and that they were a common possession and a link"
23,3721,"between their various tribes, giving them a sense of fellowship as"
23,3722,against the outer barbarians.  They were a group of kindred
23,3723,"peoples linked by the spoken and afterwards by the written word,"
23,3724,and sharing common ideals of courage and behaviour.
23,3726,"The epics showed the Greeks a barbaric people without iron,"
23,3727,"without writing, and still not living in cities.  They seem to"
23,3728,have lived at first in open villages of huts around the halls of
23,3729,their chiefs outside the ruins of the AEgean cities they had
23,3730,destroyed.  Then they began to wall their cities and to adopt the
23,3731,idea of temples from the people they had conquered.  It has been
23,3732,said that the cities of the primitive civilizations grew up about
23,3733,"the altar of some tribal god, and that the wall was added; in the"
23,3734,cities of the Greeks the wall preceded the temple.  They began to
23,3735,trade and send out colonies.  By the seventh century B.C. a new
23,3736,series of cities had grown up in the valleys and islands of
23,3737,"Greece, forgetful of the AEgean cities and civilization that had"
23,3738,"preceded them; Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Samos, Miletus"
23,3739,among the chief.  There were already Greek settlements along the
23,3740,coast of the Black Sea and in Italy and Sicily.  The heel and toe
23,3741,of Italy was called Magna Graecia.  Marseilles was a Greek town
23,3742,established on the site of an earlier Phoenician colony.
23,3744,Now countries which are great plains or which have as a chief
23,3745,means of transport some great river like the Euphrates or Nile
23,3746,tend to become united under some common rule.  The cities of Egypt
23,3747,"and the cities of Sumeria, for example, ran together under one"
23,3748,system of government. But the Greek peoples were cut up among
23,3749,islands and mountain valleys; both Greece and Magna Graecia are
23,3750,very mountainous; and the tendency was all the other way.  When
23,3751,the {130} Greeks come into history they are divided up into a
23,3752,number of little states which showed no signs of coalescence.
23,3753,They are different even in race.  Some consist chiefly of citizens
23,3754,"of this or that Greek tribe, Ionic, AEolian or Doric; some have a"
23,3755,mingled population of Greeks and descendants of the pre-Greek
23,3756,"""Mediterranean"" folk; some have an unmixed free citizenship of"
23,3757,Greeks lording it over an enslaved conquered population like the
23,3758,"""Helots"" in Sparta.  In some the old leaderly Aryan families have"
23,3759,become a close aristocracy; in some there is a democracy of all
23,3760,the Aryan citizens; in some there are elected or even hereditary
23,3761,"kings, in some usurpers or tyrants."
23,3765,And the same geographical conditions that kept the Greek states
23,3766,"divided and various, kept them small.  The largest states were"
23,3767,"smaller than many English counties, and it is doubtful if the"
23,3768,population of any of their cities ever exceeded a third of a
23,3769,"million.  Few came up even to 50,000.  There were unions of"
23,3770,interest and sympathy but no coalescences.  Cities made leagues
23,3771,"and alliances as {131} trade increased, and small cities put"
23,3772,themselves under the protection of great ones.  Yet all Greece was
23,3773,"held together in a certain community of feeling by two things, by"
23,3774,the epics and by the custom of taking part every fourth year in
23,3775,the athletic contests at Olympia.  This did not prevent wars and
23,3776,"feuds, but it mitigated something of the savagery of war between"
23,3777,"them, and a truce protected all travellers to and from the games."
23,3778,As time went on the sentiment of a common heritage grew and the
23,3779,number of states participating in the Olympic games increased
23,3780,until at last not only Greeks but competitors from the closely
23,3781,kindred countries of Epirus and Macedonia to the north were
23,3782,admitted.
23,3784,"The Greek cities grew in trade and importance, and the quality of"
23,3785,their civilization rose steadily in the seventh and sixth
23,3786,centuries B.C.  Their social life differed in many interesting
23,3787,points from the social life of the AEgean and river valley
23,3788,civilizations.  They had splendid temples but the priesthood was
23,3789,not the great traditional body it was in the cities of the older
23,3790,"world, the-repository of all knowledge, the storehouse of ideas."
23,3791,"They had leaders and noble families, but no quasi-divine monarch"
23,3792,surrounded by an elaborately organized court.  Rather their
23,3793,"organization was aristocratic, with leading families which kept"
23,3794,"each other in order.  Even their so-called ""democracies"" were"
23,3795,aristocratic; every citizen had a share in public affairs and came
23,3796,"to the assembly in a democracy, but everybody was not a _citizen_."
23,3797,"The Greek democracies were not like our modern ""democracies"" in"
23,3798,which everyone has a vote.  Many of the Greek democracies had a
23,3799,few hundred or a few thousand citizens and then many thousands of
23,3800,"slaves, freedmen and so forth, with no share in public affairs."
23,3801,Generally in Greece affairs were in the hands of a community of
23,3802,substantial men.  Their kings and their tyrants alike were just
23,3803,men set in front of other men or usurping a leadership; they were
23,3804,not quasi-divine overmen like Pharaoh or Minos or the monarchs of
23,3805,Mesopotamia.  Both thought and government therefore had a freedom
23,3806,under Greek conditions such as they had known in none of the older
23,3807,civilizations.  The Greeks had brought down into cities the
23,3808,"individualism, the personal initiative of the wandering life of"
23,3809,the northern parklands.  They were the first republicans of
23,3810,importance in history.
23,3816,And we find that as they emerge from a condition of barbaric
23,3817,warfare a new thing becomes apparent in their intellectual life.
23,3818,We find men who are not priests seeking and recording knowledge
23,3819,"and enquiring into the mysteries of life and being, in a way that"
23,3820,has hitherto been the sublime privilege of priesthood or the
23,3821,presumptuous amusement of kings.  We find already in the sixth
23,3822,century B.C.--perhaps while Isaiah was still prophesying in
23,3823,Babylon--such men as Thales and Anaximander of Miletus and
23,3824,"Heraclitus of Ephesus, who were what we should now call"
23,3825,"independent gentlemen, giving their minds to shrewd questionings"
23,3826,"of the world in which we live, asking what its real nature was,"
23,3827,"whence it came and what its destiny might be, and refusing all"
23,3828,ready-made or evasive answers.  Of these questionings of the
23,3829,"universe by the Greek mind, we shall have more to say a little"
23,3830,later in this history.  These Greek enquirers {133} who begin to
23,3831,be remarkable in the sixth century B.C. are the first
23,3832,"philosophers, the first ""wisdom-lovers,"" in the world."
23,3834,And it may be noted here how important a century this sixth
23,3835,century B.C. was in the history of humanity.  For not only were
23,3836,these Greek philosophers beginning the research for clear ideas
23,3837,about this universe and man's place in it and Isaiah carrying
23,3838,"Jewish prophecy to its sublimest levels, but as we shall tell"
23,3839,later Gautama Buddha was then teaching in India and Confucius and
23,3840,Lao Tse in China.  From Athens to the Pacific the human mind was
23,3841,astir.
24,3853,"While the Greeks in the cities in Greece, South Italy and Asia"
24,3854,Minor were embarking upon free intellectual enquiry and while in
24,3855,Babylon and Jerusalem the last of the Hebrew prophets were
24,3856,"creating a free conscience for mankind, two adventurous Aryan"
24,3857,"peoples, the Medes and the Persians, were in possession of the"
24,3858,"civilization of the ancient world and were making a great empire,"
24,3859,"the Persian empire, which was far larger in extent than any empire"
24,3860,"the world had seen hitherto.  Under Cyrus, Babylon and the rich"
24,3861,and ancient civilization of Lydia had been added to the Persian
24,3862,rule; the Phoenician cities of the Levant and all the Greek cities
24,3863,"in Asia Minor had been made tributary, Cambyses had subjected"
24,3864,"Egypt, and Darius I, the Mede, the third of the Persian rulers"
24,3865,"(521 B.C.), found himself monarch as it seemed of all the world."
24,3866,His couriers rode with his decrees from the Dardanelles to the
24,3867,Indus and from Upper Egypt to Central Asia.
24,3869,"The Greeks in Europe, it is true, Italy, Carthage, Sicily and the"
24,3870,"Spanish Phoenician settlements, were not under the Persian Peace;"
24,3871,but they treated it with respect and the only people who gave any
24,3872,serious trouble were the old parent hordes of Nordic people in
24,3873,"South Russia and Central Asia, the Scythians, who raided the"
24,3874,northern and north-eastern borders.
24,3876,Of course the population of this great Persian empire was not a
24,3877,"population of Persians, The Persians were only the small"
24,3878,conquering minority of this enormous realm.  The rest of the
24,3879,population was what it had been before the Persians came from time
24,3880,"immemorial, only that Persian was the administrative language."
24,3881,"Trade and finance were still largely Semitic, Tyre and Sidon as of"
24,3882,old were the great Mediterranean ports and Semitic shipping plied
24,3883,upon the seas.  But many of these Semitic merchants and business
24,3884,people as {135} they went from place to place already found a
24,3885,sympathetic and convenient common history in the Hebrew tradition
24,3886,and the Hebrew scriptures.  A new element which was increasing
24,3887,rapidly in this empire was the Greek element.  The Greeks were
24,3888,"becoming serious rivals to the Semites upon the sea, and their"
24,3889,"detached and vigorous intelligence made them useful and,"
24,3890,unprejudiced officials.
24,3894,It was on account of the Scythians that Darius I invaded Europe.
24,3895,"He wanted to reach South Russia, the homeland of the Scythian"
24,3896,horsemen.  He crossed the Bosphorus with a great army and marched
24,3897,"through Bulgaria to the Danube, crossed this by a bridge of boats"
24,3898,and pushed far northward.  His army suffered terribly.  It was
24,3899,largely an infantry force and the mounted Scythians rode all round
24,3900,"it, cut off its supplies, destroyed any stragglers and never came"
24,3901,to a pitched battle.  Darius was forced into an inglorious
24,3902,retreat.
24,3904,He returned himself to Susa but he left an army in Thrace and
24,3905,"Macedonia, and Macedonia submitted to Darius.  Insurrections of"
24,3906,"the Greek cities in Asia followed this failure, and the European"
24,3907,Greeks were drawn into the contest.  Darius resolved upon the
24,3908,subjugation of the Greeks in Europe.  With the Phoenician fleet at
24,3909,"his disposal he was able to subdue one island after another, and"
24,3910,finally in 490 B.C. he made his main attack upon Athens.  A
24,3911,considerable Armada sailed from the ports of Asia Minor and the
24,3912,"eastern Mediterranean, and the expedition landed its troops at"
24,3913,Marathon to the north of Athens.  There they were met and signally
24,3914,defeated by the Athenians.
24,3918,An extraordinary thing happened at this time.  The bitterest rival
24,3919,"of Athens in Greece was Sparta, but now Athens appealed to Sparta,"
24,3920,"sending a herald, a swift runner, imploring the Spartans not to"
24,3921,let Greeks become slaves to barbarians.  This runner (the
24,3922,"prototype of all ""Marathon"" runners) did over a hundred miles of"
24,3923,broken country in less than two days.  The Spartans responded
24,3924,"promptly and generously; but when, in three days, the Spartan"
24,3925,"force reached Athens, there was nothing for it to do but to view"
24,3926,the battlefield and the bodies of the defeated Persian soldiers.
24,3927,The Persian fleet had returned to Asia.  So ended the first
24,3928,Persian attack on Greece.
24,3930,The next was much more impressive.  Darius died soon after the
24,3931,"news of his defeat at Marathon reached him, and for four years his"
24,3932,"son and successor, Xerxes, prepared a host to crush the Greeks."
24,3933,For a time terror united all the Greeks.  The army of Xerxes was
24,3934,certainly the greatest that had hitherto been assembled in the
24,3935,world.  It was a huge assembly of discordant elements.  It crossed
24,3936,"the Dardanelles, 480 B.C., by a bridge of boats; and along the"
24,3937,coast as it advanced moved an equally miscellaneous fleet carrying
24,3938,supplies.  At the narrow pass of Thermopylae a small force of 1400
24,3939,"men under the Spartan Leonidas resisted this multitude, and after"
24,3940,a fight of unsurpassed heroism was completely destroyed.  Every
24,3941,man was killed.  But the losses they inflicted upon the Persians
24,3942,"were enormous, and the army of Xerxes pushed on to Thebes and"
24,3943,Athens in a chastened mood.  Thebes surrendered and made terms.
24,3944,The Athenians abandoned their city and it was burnt.
24,3954,"Greece seemed in the hands of the conqueror, but again came"
24,3955,"victory against the odds and all expectations.  The Greek fleet,"
24,3956,"though not a third the size of the Persian, assailed it in the bay"
24,3957,of Salamis and destroyed it.  Xerxes found himself and his immense
24,3958,army cut off from supplies and his heart failed him.  He retreated
24,3959,"to Asia with one half of his army, leaving the rest to be defeated"
24,3960,at Platea (479 B.C.) what time the remnants of the Persian fleet
24,3961,were hunted down by the Greeks and destroyed at Mycalae in Asia
24,3962,Minor.
24,3964,The Persian danger was at an end.  Most of the Greek cities in
24,3965,Asia became free.  All this is told in great detail and with much
24,3966,"picturesqueness in the first of written histories, the _History_"
24,3967,of {138} Herodotus.  This Herodotus was born about 484 B.C. in the
24,3968,"Ionian city of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor, and he visited Babylon"
24,3969,and Egypt in his search for exact particulars.  From Mycalae onward
24,3970,Persia sank into a confusion of dynastic troubles.  Xerxes was
24,3971,"murdered in 465 B.C. and rebellions in Egypt, Syria and Media"
24,3972,broke up the brief order of that mighty realm.  The history of
24,3973,Herodotus lays stress on the weakness of Persia.  This history is
24,3974,indeed what we should now call propaganda--propaganda for Greece
24,3975,"to unite and conquer Persia.  Herodotus makes one character,"
24,3976,"Aristagoras, go to the Spartans with a map of the known world and"
24,3977,"say to them: ""These Barbarians are not valiant in fight.  You on"
24,3978,the other hand have now attained the utmost skill in war .... No
24,3979,"other nations in the world have what they possess: gold, silver,"
24,3980,"bronze, embroidered garments, beasts and slaves.  _All this you"
24,3981,"might have for yourselves, if you so desired._"""
25,3995,The century and a half that followed the defeat of Persia was one
25,3996,of very great splendour for the Greek civilization.  True that
25,3997,Greece was torn by a desperate struggle for ascendancy between
25,3998,"Athens, Sparta and other states (the Peloponnesian War 431 to 404"
25,3999,B.C.) and that in 338 B.C. the Macedonians became virtually
25,4000,masters of Greece; nevertheless during this period the thought and
25,4001,the creative and artistic impulse of the Greeks rose to levels
25,4002,that made their achievement a lamp to mankind for all the rest of
25,4003,history.
25,4005,The head and centre of this mental activity was Athens.  For over
25,4006,thirty years (466 to 428 B.C.) Athens was dominated by a man of
25,4007,"great vigour and liberality of mind, Pericles, who set himself to"
25,4008,rebuild the city from the ashes to which the Persians had reduced
25,4009,it. The beautiful ruins that still glorify Athens to-day are
25,4010,chiefly the remains of this great effort.  And he did not simply
25,4011,rebuild a material Athens.  He rebuilt Athens intellectually.  He
25,4012,"gathered about him not only architects and sculptors but poets,"
25,4013,"dramatists, philosophers and teachers.  Herodotus came to Athens"
25,4014,to recite his history (438 B.C.). Anaxagoras came with the
25,4015,beginnings of a scientific description of the sun and stars.
25,4016,"AEschylus, Sophocles and Euripides one after the other carried the"
25,4017,Greek drama to its highest levels or beauty and nobility.
25,4019,The impetus Pericles gave to the intellectual life of Athens lived
25,4020,"on after his death, and in spite of the fact that the peace of"
25,4021,Greece was now broken by the Peloponnesian War and a long and
25,4022,"wasteful struggle for ""ascendancy"" was beginning.  Indeed the"
25,4023,darkling of the political horizon seems for a time to have
25,4024,quickened rather than discouraged men's minds.
25,4026,Already long before the time of Pericles the peculiar freedom of
25,4027,Greek institutions had given great importance to skill in
25,4028,discussion.  {140} Decision rested neither with king nor with
25,4029,priest but in the assemblies of the people or of leading men.
25,4030,Eloquence and able argument became very desirable accomplishments
25,4031,"therefore, and a class of teachers arose, the Sophists, who"
25,4032,undertook to strengthen young men in these arts.  But one cannot
25,4033,"reason without matter, and knowledge followed in the wake of"
25,4034,speech.  The activities and rivalries of these Sophists led very
25,4035,"naturally to an acute examination of style, of methods of thought"
25,4036,and of the validity of arguments.  When Pericles died a certain
25,4037,Socrates was becoming prominent as an able and destructive critic
25,4038,of bad argument--and much of the teaching of the Sophists was bad
25,4039,argument.  A group of brilliant young men gathered about Socrates.
25,4040,In the end Socrates was executed for disturbing people's minds
25,4041,"(399 B.C.), he was condemned after the dignified fashion of the"
25,4042,Athens of those days to drink in his own house and among his own
25,4043,"friends a poisonous draught made from hemlock, but the disturbance"
25,4044,of people's minds went on in spite of his condemnation. His young
25,4045,men carried on his teaching.
25,4059,Chief among these young men was Plato (427 to 347 B.C.) who
25,4060,presently began to teach philosophy in the grove of the Academy.
25,4061,"His teaching fell into two main divisions, an examination of the"
25,4062,foundations and methods of human thinking and an examination of
25,4063,"political institutions.  He was the first man to write a Utopia,"
25,4064,that is to say the plan of a community different from and better
25,4065,than any {142} existing community.  This shows an altogether
25,4066,unprecedented boldness in the human mind which had hitherto
25,4067,accepted social traditions and usages with scarcely a question.
25,4068,"Plato said plainly to mankind: ""Most of the social and political"
25,4069,"ills from which you suffer are under your control, given only the"
25,4070,will and courage to change them.  You can live in another and a
25,4071,wiser fashion if you choose to think it out and work it out.  You
25,4072,"are not awake to your own power.""  That is a high adventurous"
25,4073,teaching that has still to soak in to the common intelligence of
25,4074,"our race.  One of his earliest works was the Republic, a dream of"
25,4075,"a communist aristocracy; his last unfinished work was the Laws, a"
25,4076,scheme of regulation for another such Utopian state.
25,4080,The criticism of methods of thinking and methods of government was
25,4081,"carried on after Plato's death by Aristotle, who had been his"
25,4082,pupil and who taught in the Lyceum.  Aristotle came from the city
25,4083,"of Stagira in Macedonia, and his father was court physician to the"
25,4084,"Macedonian king.  For a time Aristotle was tutor to Alexander,"
25,4085,"{144} the king's son, who was destined to achieve very great"
25,4086,things of which we shall soon be telling.  Aristotle's work upon
25,4087,methods of thinking carried the science of Logic to a level at
25,4088,"which it remained for fifteen hundred years or more, until the"
25,4089,mediaeval schoolmen took up the ancient questions again.  He made
25,4090,no Utopias.  Before man could really control his destiny as Plato
25,4091,"taught, Aristotle perceived that he needed far more knowledge and"
25,4092,far more accurate knowledge than he possessed.  And so Aristotle
25,4093,began that systematic collection of knowledge which nowadays we
25,4094,call Science.  He sent out explorers to collect _facts_.  He was
25,4095,the father of natural history.  He was the founder of political
25,4096,science.  His students at the Lyceum examined and compared the
25,4097,constitutions of 158 different states ....
25,4103,Here in the fourth century B.C. we find men who are practically
25,4104,"""modern thinkers.""  The child-like, dream-like methods of"
25,4105,primitive thought had given way to a disciplined and critical
25,4106,attack upon the problems of life.  The weird and monstrous
25,4107,"symbolism and imagery of the gods and god monsters, and all the"
25,4108,taboos and awes and restraints that have hitherto encumbered
25,4109,"thinking are here completely set aside.  Free, exact and"
25,4110,systematic thinking has begun.  The fresh and unencumbered mind of
25,4111,these newcomers out of the northern forests has thrust itself into
25,4112,the mysteries of the temple and let the daylight in.
26,4124,From 431 to 404 B.C. the Peloponnesian War wasted Greece.
26,4125,"Meanwhile to the north of Greece, the kindred country of Macedonia"
26,4126,was rising slowly to power and civilization.  The Macedonians
26,4127,"spoke a language closely akin to Greek, and on several occasions"
26,4128,Macedonian competitors had taken part in the Olympic games.  In
26,4129,359 B.C. a man of very great abilities and ambition became king of
26,4130,this little country--Philip.  Philip had previously been a hostage
26,4131,in Greece; he had had a thoroughly Greek education and he was
26,4132,probably aware of the ideas of Herodotus--which had also been
26,4133,developed by the philosopher Isocrates--of a possible conquest of
26,4134,Asia by a consolidated Greece.
26,4136,He set himself first to extend and organize his own realm and to
26,4137,remodel his army.  For a thousand years now the charging
26,4138,"horse-chariot had been the decisive factor in battles, that and"
26,4139,"the close-fighting infantry.  Mounted horsemen had also fought,"
26,4140,"but as a cloud of skirmishers, individually and without"
26,4141,discipline.  Philip made his infantry fight in a closely packed
26,4142,"mass, the Macedonian phalanx, and he trained his mounted"
26,4143,"gentlemen, the knights or companions, to fight in formation and so"
26,4144,invented cavalry.  The master move in most of his battles and in
26,4145,the battles of his son Alexander was a cavalry charge.  The
26,4146,phalanx _held_ the enemy infantry in front while the cavalry swept
26,4147,away the enemy horse on his wings and poured in on the flank and
26,4148,"rear of his infantry.  Chariots were disabled by bowmen, who shot"
26,4149,the horses.
26,4151,With this new army Philip extended his frontiers through Thessaly
26,4152,"to Greece; and the battle of Chaeronia (338 B.C.), fought against"
26,4153,"Athens and her allies, put all Greece at his feet.  At last the"
26,4154,dream of Herodotus was bearing fruit.  A congress of all the Greek
26,4155,states appointed Philip captain-general of the Graeco-Macedonian
26,4156,"confederacy {146} against Persia, and in 336 B.C. his advanced"
26,4157,guard crossed into Asia upon this long premeditated adventure.
26,4158,But he never followed it.  He was assassinated; it is believed at
26,4159,"the instigation of his queen Olympias, Alexander's mother.  She"
26,4160,was jealous because Philip had married a second wife.
26,4162,But Philip had taken unusual pains with his son's education.  He
26,4163,"had not only secured Aristotle, the greatest philosopher in the"
26,4164,"world, as this boy's tutor, but he had shared his ideas with him"
26,4165,"and thrust military experience upon him.  At Chaeronia Alexander,"
26,4166,"who was then only eighteen years old, had been in command of the"
26,4167,"cavalry.  And so it was possible for this young man, who was still"
26,4168,"only twenty years old at the time of his accession, to take up his"
26,4169,father's task at once and to proceed successfully with the Persian
26,4170,adventure.
26,4174,In 334 B.C.--for two years were needed to establish and confirm
26,4175,"his position in Macedonia and Greece--he crossed into Asia,"
26,4176,defeated a not very much bigger Persian army at the battle of the
26,4177,Granicus and captured a number of cities in Asia Minor.  He kept
26,4178,along the sea-coast.  It was necessary for him to reduce and
26,4179,garrison all the coast towns as he advanced because the Persians
26,4180,had control of the fleets of Tyre and Sidon and so had command of
26,4181,the sea.  {147} Had he left a hostile port in his rear the
26,4182,Persians might have landed forces to raid his communications and
26,4183,cut him off. At  Issus (333 B.C.) he met and smashed a vast
26,4184,conglomerate host under Darius III.  Like the host of Xerxes that
26,4185,"had crossed the Dardanelles a century and a half before, it was an"
26,4186,incoherent accumulation of contingents and it was encumbered with
26,4187,"a multitude of court officials, the harem of Darius and many camp"
26,4188,followers.  Sidon surrendered to Alexander but Tyre resisted
26,4189,obstinately.  Finally that great city was stormed and plundered
26,4190,"and destroyed.  Gaza also was stormed, and towards the end of 332"
26,4191,B.C. the conqueror entered Egypt and took over its rule from the
26,4192,Persians.
26,4196,"At Alexandretta and at Alexandria in Egypt he built great cities,"
26,4197,accessible from the land and so incapable of revolt.  To these the
26,4198,trade of the Phoenician cities was diverted.  The Phoenicians of
26,4199,the western Mediterranean suddenly disappear from history--and as
26,4200,immediately the Jews of Alexandria and the other new trading
26,4201,cities created by Alexander appear.
26,4203,In 331 B.C. Alexander marched out of Egypt upon Babylon as
26,4204,Thothmes and Rameses and Necho had done before him.  But he
26,4205,"marched by way of Tyre.  At Arbela near the ruins of Nineveh,"
26,4206,"{148} which was already a forgotten city, he met Darius and fought"
26,4207,the decisive battle of the war.  The Persian chariot charge
26,4208,"failed, a Macedonian cavalry charge broke up the great composite"
26,4209,host and the phalanx completed the victory.  Darius led the
26,4210,retreat.  He made no further attempt to resist the invader but
26,4211,fled northward into the country of the Medes.  Alexander marched
26,4212,"on to Babylon, still prosperous and important, and then to Susa"
26,4213,and Persepolis.  There after a drunken festival he burnt down the
26,4214,"palace of Darius, the king of kings."
26,4218,"Thence Alexander presently made a military parade of central Asia,"
26,4219,going to the utmost bounds of the Persian empire.  At first he
26,4220,turned northward.  Darius was pursued; and he was overtaken at
26,4221,"dawn dying in his chariot, having been murdered by his own people."
26,4222,He was still living when the foremost Greeks reached him.
26,4223,Alexander came up to find him dead.  Alexander skirted the Caspian
26,4224,"Sea, he went up into the mountains of western Turkestan, he came"
26,4225,down by Herat (which he founded) and Cabul and the Khyber Pass
26,4226,into {149} India.  He fought a great battle on the Indus with an
26,4227,"Indian king, Porus, and here the Macedonian troops met elephants"
26,4228,for the first time and defeated them.  Finally he built himself
26,4229,"ships, sailed down to the mouth of the Indus, and marched back by"
26,4230,"the coast of Beluchistan, reaching Susa again in 324 B.C. after an"
26,4231,absence of six years.  He then prepared to consolidate and
26,4232,organize this vast empire he had won.  He sought to win over his
26,4233,new subjects.  He assumed the robes and tiara of a Persian
26,4234,"monarch, and this roused the jealousy of his Macedonian"
26,4235,commanders.  He had much trouble with them.  He arranged a number
26,4236,of marriages between these Macedonian officers and Persian and
26,4237,"Babylonian women: the ""Marriage of the East and West.""  He never"
26,4238,lived to effect the consolidation he had planned.  A fever seized
26,4239,him after a drinking bout in Babylon and he died in 323 B.C.
26,4241,Immediately this vast dominion fell to pieces.  One of his
26,4242,"generals, Seleucus, retained most of the old Persian empire from"
26,4243,"the Indus to Ephesus; another, Ptolemy, seized Egypt, and"
26,4244,Antigonus secured Macedonia.  The rest of the empire remained
26,4245,"unstable, passing under the control of a succession of local"
26,4246,adventurers.  Barbarian raids began from the north and grew in
26,4247,"scope and intensity.  Until at last, as we shall tell, a new"
26,4248,"power, the power of the Roman republic, came out of the west to"
26,4249,subjugate one fragment after another and weld them together into a
26,4250,new and more enduring empire.
27,4262,Before the time of Alexander Greeks had already been spreading as
27,4263,"merchants, artists, officials, mercenary soldiers, over most of"
27,4264,the Persian dominions.  In the dynastic disputes that followed the
27,4265,"death of Xerxes, a band of ten thousand Greek mercenaries played a"
27,4266,part under the leadership of Xenophon.  Their return to Asiatic
27,4267,Greece from Babylon is described in his Retreat of the _Ten
27,4268,"Thousand_, one of the first war stories that was ever written by a"
27,4269,general in command.  But the conquests of Alexander and the
27,4270,"division of his brief empire among his subordinate generals,"
27,4271,greatly stimulated this permeation of the ancient world by the
27,4272,Greeks and their language and fashions and culture.  Traces of
27,4273,this Greek dissemination are to be found far away in central Asia
27,4274,and in north-west India.  Their influence upon the development of
27,4275,Indian art was profound.
27,4277,For many centuries Athens retained her prestige as a centre of art
27,4278,"and culture; her schools went on indeed to 529 A.D., that is to"
27,4279,say for nearly a thousand years; but the leadership in the
27,4280,intellectual activity of the world passed presently across the
27,4281,"Mediterranean to Alexandria, the new trading city that Alexander"
27,4282,had founded.  Here the Macedonian general Ptolemy had become
27,4283,"Pharaoh, with a court that spoke Greek.  He had become an intimate"
27,4284,"of Alexander before he became king, and he was deeply saturated"
27,4285,"with the ideas of Aristotle.  He set himself, with great energy"
27,4286,"and capacity, to organize knowledge and investigation.  He also"
27,4287,"wrote a history of Alexander's campaigns which, unhappily, is lost"
27,4288,to the world.
27,4290,Alexander had already devoted considerable sums to finance the
27,4291,"enquiries of Aristotle, but Ptolemy I was the first person to make"
27,4292,a permanent endowment of science.  He set up a foundation in
27,4293,"Alexandria which was formerly dedicated to the Muses, the Museum"
27,4294,{151} of Alexandria.  For two or three generations the scientific
27,4295,"work done at Alexandria was extraordinarily good.  Euclid,"
27,4296,Eratosthenes who measured the size of the earth and came within
27,4297,"fifty miles of its true diameter, Apollonius who wrote on conic"
27,4298,"sections, Hipparchus who made the first star map and catalogue,"
27,4299,and Hero who devised the first steam engine are among the greater
27,4300,stars of an extraordinary constellation of scientific pioneers.
27,4301,"Archimedes came from Syracuse to Alexandria to study, and was a"
27,4302,frequent correspondent of the Museum.  Herophilus was one of the
27,4303,"greatest of Greek anatomists, and is said to have practised"
27,4304,vivisection.
27,4306,For a generation or so during the reigns of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy
27,4307,II there was such a blaze of knowledge and discovery at Alexandria
27,4308,as the world was not to see again until the sixteenth century A.D.
27,4309,But it did not continue.  There may have been several causes of
27,4310,"this decline.  Chief among them, the late Professor Mahaffy"
27,4311,"suggested, was the fact that the Museum was a ""royal"" college and"
27,4312,all its professors and fellows were appointed and paid by Pharaoh.
27,4313,"This was all very well when Pharaoh was Ptolemy I, the pupil and"
27,4314,friend of Aristotle.  But as the dynasty of the Ptolemies went on
27,4315,"they became Egyptianized, they fell under the sway of Egyptian"
27,4316,"priests and Egyptian religious developments, they ceased to follow"
27,4317,"the work that was done, and their control stifled the spirit of"
27,4318,enquiry altogether.  The Museum produced little good work after
27,4319,its first century of activity.
27,4321,Ptolemy I not only sought in the most modern spirit to organize
27,4322,the finding of fresh knowledge.  He tried also to set up an
27,4323,encyclopaedic storehouse of wisdom in the Library of Alexandria.
27,4324,"It was not simply a storehouse, it was also a book-copying and"
27,4325,book-selling organization.  A great army of copyists was set to
27,4326,work perpetually multiplying copies of books.
27,4328,Here then we have the definite first opening up of the
27,4329,intellectual process in which we live to-day; here we have the
27,4330,systematic gathering and distribution of knowledge.  The
27,4331,foundation of this Museum and Library marks one of the great
27,4332,epochs in the history of mankind.  It is the true beginning of
27,4333,Modern History.
27,4339,Both the work of research and the work of dissemination went on
27,4340,under serious handicaps.  One of these was the great social gap
27,4341,"that separated the philosopher, who was a gentleman, from the"
27,4342,trader and the artisan.  There were glass workers and metal
27,4343,"workers in abundance in those days, but they were not in mental"
27,4344,contact with the thinkers.  The glass worker was making the most
27,4345,"beautifully coloured beads and phials and so forth, but he never"
27,4346,made a Florentine flask or a lens.  Clear glass does not seem to
27,4347,have interested him.  The metal worker made weapons and jewellery
27,4348,but he never made a chemical balance.  The philosopher speculated
27,4349,"loftily about atoms and the nature of things, but he had no"
27,4350,practical experience of enamels and pigments and philters and so
27,4351,forth.  He was not interested in substances.  So Alexandria in its
27,4352,brief day of opportunity produced no microscopes and no
27,4353,chemistry.  And though Hero invented a steam engine it was never
27,4354,set either to pump or drive a boat or do any useful thing.  There
27,4355,were few practical applications of science except in the realm of
27,4356,"medicine, and the progress of science was not stimulated and"
27,4357,sustained by the interest and excitement of practical
27,4358,applications.  There was nothing to keep the work going therefore
27,4359,when the intellectual curiosity of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II {153}
27,4360,was withdrawn.  The discoveries of the Museum went on record in
27,4361,"obscure manuscripts and never, until the revival of scientific"
27,4362,"curiosity at the Renascence, reached out to the mass of mankind."
27,4366,Nor did the Library produce any improvements in book making.  That
27,4367,ancient world had no paper made in definite sizes from rag pulp.
27,4368,Paper was a Chinese invention and it did not reach the western
27,4369,world until the ninth century A.D.  The only book materials were
27,4370,parchment and strips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge.
27,4371,These strips were kept on rolls which were very unwieldy to wind
27,4372,"to and fro and read, and very inconvenient for reference.  It was"
27,4373,these things that prevented the development of paged and printed
27,4374,books.  Printing itself was known in the world it would seem as
27,4375,early as the Old Stone Age; there were seals in ancient Sumeria;
27,4376,but without abundant paper there was little advantage in printing
27,4377,"books, an improvement that may further have been resisted by"
27,4378,trades unionism on the part of the copyists employed.  Alexandria
27,4379,"produced abundant books but not cheap books, and it never spread"
27,4380,knowledge into the population of the ancient world below the level
27,4381,of a wealthy and influential class.
27,4383,So it was that this blaze of intellectual enterprise never reached
27,4384,beyond a small circle of people in touch with the group of
27,4385,philosophers collected by the first two Ptolemies.  It was like
27,4386,the light in a dark lantern which is shut off from the world at
27,4387,"large.  Within the blaze may be blindingly bright, but"
27,4388,nevertheless it is unseen.  The rest of the world went on its old
27,4389,ways unaware that the seed of scientific knowledge that was one
27,4390,day to revolutionize it altogether had been sown.  Presently a
27,4391,darkness of bigotry fell even upon {154} Alexandria. Thereafter
27,4392,for a thousand years of darkness the seed that Aristotle had sown
27,4393,lay hidden.  Then it stirred and began to germinate.  In a few
27,4394,centuries it had become that widespread growth of knowledge and
27,4395,clear ideas that is now changing the whole of human life.
27,4399,Alexandria was not the only centre of Greek intellectual activity
27,4400,in the third century B.C.  There were many other cities that
27,4401,displayed a brilliant intellectual life amidst the disintegrating
27,4402,"fragments of the brief empire of Alexander.  There was, for"
27,4403,"example, the Greek city of Syracuse in Sicily, where thought and"
27,4404,science flourished for two centuries; there was Pergamum in Asia
27,4405,"Minor, which also had a great library.  But this brilliant"
27,4406,Hellenic world was now stricken by invasion from the north.  New
27,4407,"Nordic barbarians, the Gauls, were striking down along the tracks"
27,4408,that had once been followed by the ancestors of the Greeks and
27,4409,"Phrygians and Macedonians.  They raided, shattered and destroyed."
27,4410,And in the wake of the Gauls came a new conquering people out of
27,4411,"Italy, the Romans, who gradually subjugated all the western half"
27,4412,of the vast realm of Darius and Alexander.  They were an able but
27,4413,"unimaginative people, preferring law and profit to either science"
27,4414,or art.  {155} New invaders were also coming down out of central
27,4415,Asia to shatter and subdue the Seleucid empire and to cut off the
27,4416,"western world again from India.  These were the Parthians, hosts"
27,4417,"of mounted bowmen, who treated the Graeco-Persian empire of"
27,4418,Persepolis and Susa in the third century B.C. in much the same
27,4419,fashion that the Medes and Persians had treated it in the seventh
27,4420,and sixth.  And there were now other nomadic peoples also coming
27,4421,"out of the northeast, peoples who were not fair and Nordic and"
27,4422,Aryan-speaking but yellow-skinned and black-haired and with a
27,4423,Mongolian speech.  But of these latter people we shall tell more
27,4424,in a subsequent chapter.
28,4436,But now we must go back three centuries in our story to tell of a
28,4437,great teacher who came near to revolutionizing the religious
28,4438,"thought and feeling of all Asia.  This was Gautama Buddha, who"
28,4439,taught his disciples at Benares in India about the same time that
28,4440,Isaiah was prophesying among the Jews in Babylon and Heraclitus
28,4441,was carrying on his speculative enquiries into the nature of
28,4442,things at Ephesus.  All these men were in the world at the same
28,4443,"time, in the sixth century B.C.--unaware of one another."
28,4445,This sixth century B.C. was indeed one of the most remarkable in
28,4446,all history.  Everywhere--for as we shall tell it was also the
28,4447,case in China--men's minds were displaying a new boldness.
28,4448,Everywhere they were waking up out of the traditions of kingships
28,4449,and priests and blood sacrifices and asking the most penetrating
28,4450,questions.  It is as if the race had reached a stage of
28,4451,adolescence--after a childhood of twenty thousand years.
28,4453,The early history of India is still very obscure.  Somewhen
28,4454,"perhaps about 2000 B.C., an Aryan-speaking people came down from"
28,4455,the north-west into India either in one invasion or in a series of
28,4456,invasions; and was able to spread its language and traditions over
28,4457,most of north India.  Its peculiar variety of Aryan speech was the
28,4458,Sanskrit.  They found a brunette people with a more elaborate
28,4459,"civilization and less vigour of will, in possession of the country"
28,4460,of the Indus and Ganges.  But they do not seem to have mingled
28,4461,with their predecessors as freely as did the Greeks and Persians.
28,4462,They remained aloof.  When the past of India becomes dimly visible
28,4463,"to the historian, Indian society is already stratified into"
28,4464,"several layers, with a variable number of"
28,4465,"sub-divisions, which do not eat together nor intermarry nor"
28,4466,associate freely.  And throughout history this {157}
28,4467,stratification into castes continues.  This makes the Indian
28,4468,"population something different from the simple, freely"
28,4469,inter-breeding European or Mongolian communities.  It is really a
28,4470,community of communities.
28,4472,Siddhattha Gautama was the son of an aristocratic family which
28,4473,ruled a small district on the Himalayan slopes.  He was married at
28,4474,nineteen to a beautiful cousin.  He hunted and played and went
28,4475,about in his sunny world of gardens and groves and irrigated
28,4476,rice-fields.  And it was amidst this life that a great discontent
28,4477,fell upon him.  It was the unhappiness of a fine brain that seeks
28,4478,employment.  He felt that the existence he was leading was not the
28,4479,"reality of life, but a holiday--a holiday that had gone on too"
28,4480,long.
28,4482,"The sense of disease and mortality, the insecurity and the"
28,4483,"un-satisfactoriness of all happiness, descended upon the mind of"
28,4484,Gautama.  While he was in this mood he met one of those wandering
28,4485,ascetics who already existed in great numbers in India.  These men
28,4486,"lived under severe rules, spending much time in meditation and in"
28,4487,religious discussion.  They were supposed to be seeking some
28,4488,"deeper reality in life, and a passionate desire to do likewise"
28,4489,took possession of Gautama.
28,4491,"He was meditating upon this project, says the story, when the news"
28,4492,was brought to him that his wife had been delivered of his
28,4493,"first-born son. ""This is another tie to break,"" said Gautama."
28,4495,He returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his fellow
28,4496,clansmen.  There was a great feast and a Nautch dance to celebrate
28,4497,"the birth of this new tie, and in the night Gautama awoke in a"
28,4498,"great agony of spirit, ""like a man who is told that his house is"
28,4499,"on fire.""  He resolved to leave his happy aimless life forthwith."
28,4500,"He went softly to the threshold of his wife's chamber, and saw her"
28,4501,"by the light of a little oil lamp, sleeping sweetly, surrounded by"
28,4502,"flowers, with his infant son in her arms.  He felt a great craving"
28,4503,to take up the child in one first and last embrace before he
28,4504,"departed, but the fear of waking his wife prevented him, and at"
28,4505,last he turned away and went out into the bright Indian moonshine
28,4506,and mounted his horse and rode off into the world.
28,4512,"Very far he rode that night, and in the morning he stopped outside"
28,4513,"{159} the lands of his clan, and dismounted beside a sandy river."
28,4514,"There he cut off his flowing locks with his sword, removed all his"
28,4515,ornaments and sent them and his horse and sword back to his house.
28,4516,Going on he presently met a ragged man and exchanged clothes with
28,4517,"him, and so having divested himself of all worldly entanglements"
28,4518,he was free to pursue his search after wisdom.  He made his way
28,4519,southward to a resort of hermits and teachers in a hilly spur of
28,4520,the Vindhya Mountains.  There lived a number of wise men in a
28,4521,"warren of caves, going into the town for their simple supplies and"
28,4522,imparting their knowledge by word of mouth to such as cared to
28,4523,come to them.  Gautama became versed in all the metaphysics of his
28,4524,age.  But his acute intelligence was dissatisfied with the
28,4525,solutions offered him.
28,4529,The Indian mind has always been disposed to believe that power and
28,4530,"knowledge may be obtained by extreme asceticism, by fasting,"
28,4531,"sleeplessness, and self-torment, and these ideas Gautama now put"
28,4532,to the test.  He betook himself with five disciple companions to
28,4533,the jungle and there he gave himself up to fasting and terrible
28,4534,"penances.  His fame spread, ""like the sound of a great {160} bell"
28,4535,"hung in the canopy of the skies.""  But it brought him no sense of"
28,4536,"truth achieved.  One day he was walking up and down, trying to"
28,4537,think in spite of his enfeebled state.  Suddenly he fell
28,4538,"unconscious.  When he recovered, the preposterousness of these"
28,4539,semi-magical ways to wisdom was plain to him.
28,4543,He horrified his companions by demanding ordinary food and
28,4544,refusing to continue his mortifications.  He had realized that
28,4545,whatever truth a man may reach is reached best by a nourished
28,4546,brain in a healthy body.  Such a conception was absolutely foreign
28,4547,"to the ideas of the land and age.  His disciples deserted him, and"
28,4548,went off in a melancholy state to Benares.  Gautama wandered
28,4549,alone.
28,4551,"When the mind grapples with a great and intricate problem, it"
28,4552,"makes its advances step by step, with but little realization of"
28,4553,"the gains it has made, until suddenly, with an effect of abrupt"
28,4554,"illumination, it realizes its victory.  So it happened to Gautama."
28,4555,He had seated himself under a great tree by the side of a river to
28,4556,"eat, when this sense of clear vision came to him.  It seemed to"
28,4557,him that he saw life plain.  He is said to have sat all day and
28,4558,"all night in profound thought, and then he rose up to impart his"
28,4559,vision to the world.
28,4561,He went on to Benares and there he sought out and won back his
28,4562,lost disciples to his new teaching.  In the King's Deer Park at
28,4563,Benares they built themselves huts and set up a sort of school to
28,4564,which came many who were seeking after wisdom.
28,4566,The starting point of his teaching was his own question as a
28,4567,"fortunate {161} young man, ""Why am I not completely happy?""  It"
28,4568,was an introspective question.  It was a question very different
28,4569,in quality from the frank and self-forgetful _externalized_
28,4570,curiosity with which Thales and Heraclitus were attacking the
28,4571,"problems of the universe, or the equally self-forgetful burthen of"
28,4572,moral obligation that the culminating prophets were imposing upon
28,4573,"the Hebrew mind.  The Indian teacher did not forget self, he"
28,4574,"concentrated upon self and sought to destroy it.  All suffering,"
28,4575,"he taught, was due to the greedy desires of the individual.  Until"
28,4576,man has conquered his personal cravings his life is trouble and
28,4577,his end sorrow.  There were three principal forms that the craving
28,4578,for life took and they were all evil.  The first was the desire of
28,4579,"the appetites, greed and all forms of sensuousness, the second was"
28,4580,"the desire for a personal and egotistic immortality, the third was"
28,4581,"the craving for personal success, worldliness, avarice and the"
28,4582,like.  All these forms of desire had to be overcome to escape from
28,4583,"the distresses and chagrins of life.  When they were overcome,"
28,4584,"when self had vanished altogether, then serenity of soul, Nirvana,"
28,4585,the highest good was attained.
28,4587,"This was the gist of his teaching, a very subtle and metaphysical"
28,4588,"teaching indeed, not nearly so easy to understand as the Greek"
28,4589,injunction to see and know fearlessly and rightly and the Hebrew
28,4590,command to fear God and accomplish righteousness.  It was a
28,4591,teaching much beyond the understanding of even Gautama's immediate
28,4592,"disciples, and it is no wonder that so soon as his personal"
28,4593,influence was withdrawn it became corrupted and coarsened.  There
28,4594,was a widespread belief in India at that time that at long
28,4595,intervals Wisdom came to earth and was incarnate in some chosen
28,4596,person who was known as the Buddha.  Gautama's disciples declared
28,4597,"that he was a Buddha, the latest of the Buddhas, though there is"
28,4598,no evidence that he himself ever accepted the title.  Before he
28,4599,"was well dead, a cycle of fantastic legends began to be woven"
28,4600,about him.  The human heart has always preferred a wonder story to
28,4601,"a moral effort, and Gautama Buddha became very wonderful."
28,4603,Yet there remained a substantial gain in the world.  If Nirvana
28,4604,"was too high and subtle for most men's imaginations, if the"
28,4605,myth-making impulse in the race was too strong for the simple
28,4606,"facts of Gautama's life, they could at least grasp something of"
28,4607,"the intention {162} of what Gautama called the Eight-fold way, the"
28,4608,Aryan or Noble Path in life.  In this there was an insistence upon
28,4609,"mental uprightness, upon right aims and speech, right conduct and"
28,4610,honest livelihood.  There was a quickening of the conscience and
28,4611,an appeal to generous and self-forgetful ends.
29,4623,"For some generations after the death of Gautama, these high and"
29,4624,"noble Buddhist teachings, this first plain teaching that the"
29,4625,"highest good for man is the subjugation of self, made"
29,4626,comparatively little headway in the world.  Then they conquered
29,4627,the imagination of one of the greatest monarchs the world has ever
29,4628,seen.
29,4630,We have already mentioned how Alexander the Great came down into
29,4631,India and fought with Porus upon the Indus.  It is related by the
29,4632,Greek historians that a certain Chandragupta Maurya came into
29,4633,Alexander's camp and tried to persuade him to go on to the Ganges
29,4634,and conquer all India.  Alexander could not do this because of the
29,4635,refusal of his Macedonians to go further into what was for them an
29,4636,"unknown world, and later on (303 B.C.) Chandragupta was able to"
29,4637,secure the help or various hill tribes and realize his dream
29,4638,without Greek help.  He built up an empire in North India and was
29,4639,presently (303 B.C.) able to attack Seleucus I in the Punjab and
29,4640,drive the last vestige of Greek power out of India.  His son
29,4641,"extended this new empire.  His grandson, Asoka, the monarch of"
29,4642,"whom we now have to tell, found himself in 264 B.C. ruling from"
29,4643,Afghanistan to Madras.
29,4645,Asoka was at first disposed to follow the example of his father
29,4646,and grandfather and complete the conquest of the Indian peninsula.
29,4647,"He invaded Kalinga (255 B.C.), a country on the east coast of"
29,4648,"Madras, he was successful in his military operations and--alone"
29,4649,among conquerors--he was so disgusted by the cruelty and horror of
29,4650,war that he renounced it.  He would have no more of it.  He
29,4651,adopted the peaceful doctrines of Buddhism and declared that
29,4652,henceforth his conquests should be the conquests of religion.
29,4658,His reign for eight-and-twenty years was one of the brightest
29,4659,interludes in the troubled history of mankind.  He organized a
29,4660,great digging of wells in India and the planting of trees for
29,4661,shade.  He founded hospitals and public gardens and gardens for
29,4662,the growing of medicinal herbs.  He created a ministry for the
29,4663,care of the aborigines and subject races of India.  He made
29,4664,provision for the education of women.  He made vast benefactions
29,4665,"to the Buddhist teaching orders, and tried to stimulate them to a"
29,4666,better and more energetic criticism of their own accumulated
29,4667,literature.  For corruptions and superstitious accretions had
29,4668,accumulated very {165} speedily upon the pure and simple teaching
29,4669,of the great Indian master.  Missionaries went from Asoka to
29,4670,"Kashmir, to Persia, to Ceylon and Alexandria."
29,4676,"Such was Asoka, greatest of kings.  He was far in advance of his"
29,4677,age.  He left no prince and no organization of men to carry on his
29,4678,"work, and within a century of his death the great days of his"
29,4679,reign had become a glorious memory in a shattered and decaying
29,4680,"India.  The priestly caste of the Brahmins, the highest and most"
29,4681,"privileged caste in the Indian social body, has always been"
29,4682,opposed to the frank and open teaching of Buddha.  Gradually they
29,4683,undermined the Buddhist influence in the land.  The old monstrous
29,4684,"gods, the innumerable cults of Hinduism, resumed their sway."
29,4685,Caste became {166} more rigorous and complicated.  For long
29,4686,"centuries Buddhism and Brahminism flourished side by side, and"
29,4687,then slowly Buddhism decayed and Brahminism in a multitude of
29,4688,forms replaced it.  But beyond the confines of India and the
29,4689,realms of caste Buddhism spread--until it had won China and Siam
29,4690,"and Burma and Japan, countries in which it is predominant to this"
29,4691,day.
30,4705,"We have still to tell of two other great men, Confucius and Lao"
30,4706,"Tse, who lived in that wonderful century which began the"
30,4707,"adolescence of mankind, the sixth century B.C.  In this history"
30,4708,thus far we have told very little of the early story of China.  At
30,4709,"present that early history is still very obscure, and we look to"
30,4710,Chinese explorers and archaeolologists in the new China that is now
30,4711,arising to work out their past as thoroughly as the European past
30,4712,has been worked out during the last century.  Very long ago the
30,4713,first primitive Chinese civilizations arose in the great river
30,4714,"valleys out of the primordial heliolithic culture.  They had, like"
30,4715,"Egypt and Sumeria, the general characteristics of that culture,"
30,4716,and they centred upon temples in which priests and priest kings
30,4717,offered the seasonal blood sacrifices.  The life in those cities
30,4718,must have been very like the Egyptian and Sumerian life of six or
30,4719,seven thousand years ago and very like the Maya life of Central
30,4720,America a thousand years ago.
30,4722,If there were human sacrifices they had long given way to animal
30,4723,sacrifices before the dawn of history.  And a form of picture
30,4724,writing was growing up long before a thousand years B.C.
30,4726,And just as the primitive civilizations of Europe and western Asia
30,4727,were in conflict with the nomads of the desert and the nomads of
30,4728,"the north, so the primitive Chinese civilizations had a great"
30,4729,cloud of nomadic peoples on their northern borders.  There was a
30,4730,"number of tribes akin in language and ways of living, who are"
30,4731,"spoken of in history in succession as the Huns, the Mongols, the"
30,4732,Turks and Tartars.  They changed and divided and combined and
30,4733,"re-combined, just as the Nordic peoples in north Europe and central"
30,4734,Asia changed and varied in name rather than in nature.  These
30,4735,"Mongolian nomads had horses earlier than the Nordic peoples, and"
30,4736,it may {168} be that in the region of the Altai Mountains they
30,4737,made an independent discovery of iron somewhen after 1000 B.C.
30,4738,And just as in the western case so ever and again these eastern
30,4739,"nomads would achieve a sort of political unity, and become the"
30,4740,conquerors and masters and revivers of this or that settled and
30,4741,civilized region.
30,4743,It is quite possible that the earliest civilization of China was
30,4744,not Mongolian at all any more than the earliest civilization of
30,4745,Europe and western Asia was Nordic or Semitic.  It is quite
30,4746,possible that the earliest civilization of China was a brunette
30,4747,"civilization and of a piece with the earliest Egyptian, Sumerian"
30,4748,"and Dravidian civilizations, and that when the first recorded"
30,4749,history of China began there had already been conquests and
30,4750,intermixture.  At any rate we find that by 1750 B.C. China was
30,4751,"already a vast system of little kingdoms and city states, all"
30,4752,acknowledging a loose allegiance and paying more or less
30,4753,"regularly, more or less definite feudal dues to one great priest"
30,4754,"emperor, the ""Son of Heaven.""  The ""Shang"" dynasty came to an end"
30,4755,"in 1125 B.C.  A ""Chow"" dynasty succeeded ""Shang,"" and maintained"
30,4756,China in a relaxing unity until the days of Asoka in India and of
30,4757,the Ptolemies in Egypt.  Gradually China went to pieces during
30,4758,"that long ""Chow"" period.  Hunnish peoples came down and set up"
30,4759,principalities; local rulers discontinued their tribute and became
30,4760,"independent.  There was in the sixth century B.C., says one"
30,4761,"Chinese authority, five or six thousand practically independent"
30,4762,states in China.  It was what the Chinese call in their records an
30,4763,"""Age of Confusion."""
30,4765,But this Age of Confusion was compatible with much intellectual
30,4766,activity and with the existence of many local centres of art and
30,4767,civilized living.  When we know more of Chinese history we shall
30,4768,"find that China also had her Miletus and her Athens, her Pergamum"
30,4769,and her Macedonia.  At present we must be vague and brief about
30,4770,this period of Chinese division simply because our knowledge is
30,4771,not sufficient for us to frame a coherent and consecutive story.
30,4781,And just as in divided Greece there were philosophers and in
30,4782,"shattered and captive Jewry prophets, so in disordered China there"
30,4783,were philosophers and teachers at this time.  In all these cases
30,4784,{170} insecurity and uncertainty seemed to have quickened the
30,4785,better sort of mind.  Confucius was a man of aristocratic origin
30,4786,and some official importance in a small state called Lu.  Here in
30,4787,a very parallel mood to the Greek impulse he set up a sort of
30,4788,Academy for discovering and teaching Wisdom.  The lawlessness and
30,4789,disorder of China distressed him profoundly.  He conceived an
30,4790,"ideal of a better government and a better life, and travelled from"
30,4791,state to state seeking a prince who would carry out his
30,4792,legislative and educational ideas.  He never found his prince; he
30,4793,"found a prince, but court intrigues undermined the influence of"
30,4794,the teacher and finally defeated his reforming proposals.  It is
30,4795,interesting to note that a century and a half later the Greek
30,4796,"philosopher Plato also sought a prince, and was for a time adviser"
30,4797,to the tyrant Dionysius who ruled Syracuse in Sicily.
30,4799,"Confucius died a disappointed man.  ""No intelligent ruler arises"
30,4800,"to take me as his master,"" he said, ""and my time has come to die."""
30,4801,But his teaching had more vitality than he imagined in his
30,4802,"declining and hopeless years, and it became a great formative"
30,4803,influence with the Chinese people.  It became one of what the
30,4804,"Chinese call the Three Teachings, the other two being those of"
30,4805,Buddha and of Lao Tse.
30,4807,The gist of the teaching of Confucius was the way of the noble or
30,4808,aristocratic man.  He was concerned with personal conduct as much
30,4809,as Gautama was concerned with the peace of self-forgetfulness and
30,4810,the Greek with external knowledge and the Jew with righteousness.
30,4811,He was the most public-minded of all great teachers.  He was
30,4812,"supremely concerned by the confusion and miseries of the world,"
30,4813,and he wanted to make men noble in order to bring about a noble
30,4814,world.  He sought to regulate conduct to an extraordinary extent;
30,4815,"to provide sound rules for every occasion in life.  A polite,"
30,4816,"public-spirited gentleman, rather sternly self-disciplined, was"
30,4817,the ideal he found already developing in the northern Chinese
30,4818,world and one to which he gave a permanent form.
30,4827,"The teaching of Lao Tse, who was for a long time in charge of the"
30,4828,"imperial library of the Chow dynasty, was much more mystical and"
30,4829,vague and elusive than that of Confucius.  He seems to have
30,4830,preached a stoical indifference to the pleasures and powers of
30,4831,{172} the world and a return to an imaginary simple life of the
30,4832,past.  He left writings very contracted in style and very obscure.
30,4833,"He wrote in riddles.  After his death his teachings, like the"
30,4834,"teachings of Gautama Buddha, were corrupted and overlaid by"
30,4835,legends and had the most complex and extraordinary observances and
30,4836,superstitious ideas grafted upon them.  In China just as in India
30,4837,primordial ideas of magic and monstrous legends out of the
30,4838,childish past of our race struggled against the new thinking in
30,4839,"the world and succeeded in plastering it over with grotesque,"
30,4840,irrational and antiquated observances.  Both Buddhism and Taoism
30,4841,(which ascribes itself largely to Lao Tse) as one finds them in
30,4842,"China now, are religions of monk, temple, priest and offering of a"
30,4843,"type as ancient in form, if not in thought, as the sacrificial"
30,4844,religions of ancient Sumeria and Egypt.  But the teaching {173} of
30,4845,Confucius was not so overlaid because it was limited and plain and
30,4846,straightforward and lent itself to no such distortions.
30,4850,"North China, the China of the Hwang-ho River, became Confucian in"
30,4851,"thought and spirit; south China, Yang-tse-Kiang China, became"
30,4852,Taoist.  Since those days a conflict has always been traceable in
30,4853,"Chinese affairs between these two spirits, the spirit of the north"
30,4854,"and the spirit of the south, between (in latter times) Pekin and"
30,4855,"Nankin, between the official-minded, upright and conservative"
30,4856,"north, and the sceptical, artistic, lax and experimental south."
30,4858,The divisions of China of the Age of Confusion reached their worst
30,4859,stage in the sixth century B.C.  The Chow dynasty was so enfeebled
30,4860,and so discredited that Lao Tse left the unhappy court and retired
30,4861,into private life.
30,4863,Three nominally subordinate powers dominated the situation in
30,4864,"those days, Ts'i and Ts'in, both northern powers, and Ch'u, which"
30,4865,was an aggressive military power in the Yangtse valley.  At last
30,4866,"Ts'i and Ts'in formed an alliance, subdued Ch'u and imposed a"
30,4867,general treaty of disarmament and peace in China.  The power of
30,4868,Ts'in became predominant.  Finally about the time of Asoka in
30,4869,India the Ts'in monarch seized upon the sacrificial vessels of the
30,4870,"Chow emperor and took over his sacrificial duties.  His son,"
30,4871,"Shi-Hwang-ti (king in 246 B.C., emperor in 220 B.C.), is called in"
30,4872,"the Chinese Chronicles ""the First Universal Emperor."""
30,4874,"More fortunate than Alexander, Shi-Hwang-ti reigned for"
30,4875,thirty-six years as king and emperor.  His energetic reign marks
30,4876,the beginning of a new era of unity and prosperity for the Chinese
30,4877,people.  He fought vigorously against the Hunnish invaders from
30,4878,"the northern deserts, and he began that immense work, the Great"
30,4879,"Wall of China, to set a limit to their incursions."
31,4891,The reader will note a general similarity in the history of all
31,4892,these civilizations in spite of the effectual separation caused by
31,4893,the great barriers of the Indian north-west frontier and of the
31,4894,mountain masses of Central Asia and further India.  First for
31,4895,thousands of years the heliolithic culture spread over all the
31,4896,warm and fertile river valleys of the old world and developed a
31,4897,temple system and priest rulers about its sacrificial traditions.
31,4898,Apparently its first makers were always those brunette peoples we
31,4899,have spoken of as the central race of mankind.  Then the nomads
31,4900,came in from the regions of seasonal grass and seasonal migrations
31,4901,and superposed their own characteristics and often their own
31,4902,language on the primitive civilization.  They subjugated and
31,4903,"stimulated it, and were stimulated to fresh developments and made"
31,4904,it here one thing and here another.  In Mesopotamia it was the
31,4905,"Elamite and then the Semite, and at last the Nordic Medes and"
31,4906,Persians and the Greeks who supplied the ferment; over the region
31,4907,of the AEgean peoples it was the Greeks; in India it was the
31,4908,Aryan-speakers; in Egypt there was a thinner infusion of conquerors
31,4909,"into a more intensely saturated priestly civilization; in China,"
31,4910,the Hun conquered and was absorbed and was followed by fresh Huns.
31,4911,China was Mongolized just as Greece and North India were Aryanized
31,4912,and Mesopotamia Semitized and Aryanized.  Everywhere the nomads
31,4913,"destroyed much, but everywhere they brought in a new spirit of"
31,4914,free enquiry and moral innovation.  They questioned the beliefs of
31,4915,immemorial ages.  They let daylight into the temples.  They set up
31,4916,kings who were neither priests nor gods but mere leaders among
31,4917,their captains and companions.
31,4927,In the centuries following the sixth century B.C. we find
31,4928,everywhere a great breaking down of ancient traditions and a new
31,4929,"spirit {176} of moral and intellectual enquiry awake, a spirit"
31,4930,never more to be altogether stilled in the great progressive
31,4931,movement of mankind.  We find reading and writing becoming common
31,4932,and accessible accomplishments among the ruling and prosperous
31,4933,minority; they were no longer the jealously guarded secret of the
31,4934,priests.  Travel is increasing and transport growing easier by
31,4935,reason of horses and roads.  A new and easy device to facilitate
31,4936,trade has been found in coined money.
31,4938,Let us now transfer our attention back from China in the extreme
31,4939,east of the old world to the western half of the Mediterranean.
31,4940,Here we have to note the appearance of a city which was destined
31,4941,"to play at last a very great part indeed in human affairs, Rome."
31,4943,Hitherto we have told very little about Italy in our story.  It
31,4944,was before 1000 B.C. a land of mountain and forest and thinly
31,4945,populated.  Aryan-speaking tribes had pressed down this peninsula
31,4946,"and formed little towns and cities, and the southern extremity was"
31,4947,studded with Greek settlements.  The noble ruins of Paestum
31,4948,preserve for us to this day something of the dignity and splendour
31,4949,"of these early Greek establishments.  A non-Aryan people, probably"
31,4950,"akin to the AEgean peoples, the Etruscans, had established"
31,4951,themselves in the central part of the peninsula.  They had
31,4952,reversed the usual process by subjugating various Aryan tribes.
31,4953,"Rome, when it comes into the light of history, is a little trading"
31,4954,"city at a ford on the Tiber, with a Latin-speaking population"
31,4955,ruled over by Etruscan kings.  The old chronologies gave 753 B.C.
31,4956,"as the date of the founding of Rome, half a century later than the"
31,4957,founding of the great Phoenician city of Carthage and twenty-three
31,4958,years after the first Olympiad.  Etruscan tombs of a much earlier
31,4959,"date than 753 B.C. have, however, been excavated in the Roman"
31,4960,Forum.
31,4962,"In that red-letter century, the sixth century B.C., the Etruscan"
31,4963,kings were expelled (510 B.C.) and Rome became an aristocratic
31,4964,"republic with a lordly class of ""patrician"" families dominating a"
31,4965,"commonalty of ""plebeians.""  Except that it spoke Latin it was not"
31,4966,unlike many aristocratic Greek republics.
31,4968,For some centuries the internal history of Rome was the story of a
31,4969,long and obstinate struggle for freedom and a share in the
31,4970,government on the part of the plebeians.  It would not be
31,4971,"difficult to find {177} Greek parallels to this conflict, which"
31,4972,the Greeks would have called a conflict of aristocracy with
31,4973,democracy.  In the end the plebeians broke down most of the
31,4974,exclusive barriers of the old families and established a working
31,4975,"equality with them.  They destroyed the old exclusiveness, and"
31,4976,made it possible and acceptable for Rome to extend her citizenship
31,4977,"by the inclusion of more and more ""outsiders.""  For while she"
31,4978,"still struggled at home, she was extending her power abroad."
31,4982,The extension of Roman power began in the fifth century B.C.
31,4983,"Until that time they had waged war, and generally unsuccessful"
31,4984,"war, with the Etruscans.  There was an Etruscan fort, Veii, only a"
31,4985,few miles from Rome which the Romans had never been able to
31,4986,"capture.  In 474 B.C., however, a great misfortune came to the"
31,4987,Etruscans.  Their fleet was destroyed by the Greeks of Syracuse in
31,4988,Sicily.  {178} At the same time a wave of Nordic invaders came
31,4989,"down upon them from the north, the Gauls.  Caught between Roman"
31,4990,"and Gaul, the Etruscans fell--and disappear from history.  Veii"
31,4991,"was captured by the Romans, The Gauls came through to Rome and"
31,4992,sacked the city (390 B.C.) but could not capture the Capitol.  An
31,4993,attempted night surprise was betrayed by the cackling of some
31,4994,"geese, and finally the invaders were bought off and retired to the"
31,4995,north of Italy again.
31,4997,The Gaulish raid seems to have invigorated rather than weakened
31,4998,"Rome.  The Romans conquered and assimilated the Etruscans, and"
31,4999,extended their power over all central Italy from the Arno to
31,5000,Naples.  To this they had reached within a few years of 300 B.C.
31,5001,Their conquests in Italy were going on simultaneously with the
31,5002,"growth of Philip's power in Macedonia and Greece, and the"
31,5003,tremendous raid of Alexander to Egypt and the Indus.  The Romans
31,5004,had become notable people in the civilized world to the east of
31,5005,them by the break-up of Alexander's empire.
31,5007,To the north of the Roman power were the Gauls; to the south of
31,5008,"them were the Greek settlements of Magna Graecia, that is to say of"
31,5009,"Sicily and of the toe and heel of Italy.  The Gauls were a hardy,"
31,5010,warlike people and the Romans held that boundary by a line of
31,5011,forts and fortified settlements.  The Greek cities in the south
31,5012,"headed by Tarentum (now Taranto) and by Syracuse in Sicily, did"
31,5013,not so much threaten as fear the Romans.  They looked about for
31,5014,some help against these new conquerors.
31,5016,We have already told how the empire of Alexander fell to pieces
31,5017,and was divided among his generals and companions.  Among these
31,5018,"adventurers was a kinsman of Alexander's named Pyrrhus, who"
31,5019,"established himself in Epirus, which is across the Adriatic Sea"
31,5020,over against the heel of Italy.  It was his ambition to play the
31,5021,"part of Philip of Macedonia to Magna Graecia, and to become"
31,5022,"protector and master-general of Tarentum, Syracuse and the rest of"
31,5023,that part of the world.  He had what was then it very efficient
31,5024,"modern army; he had an infantry phalanx, cavalry from"
31,5025,Thessaly--which was now quite as good as the original Macedonian
31,5026,cavalry--and twenty fighting elephants; he invaded Italy and routed
31,5027,"the Romans in two considerable battles, Heraclea (280 B.C.) and"
31,5028,"Ausculum (279 B.C.), and {179} having driven them north, he turned"
31,5029,his attention to the subjugation of Sicily.
31,5031,But this brought against him a more formidable enemy than were the
31,5032,"Romans at that time, the Phoenician trading city of Carthage,"
31,5033,which was probably then the greatest city in the world.  Sicily
31,5034,"was too near Carthage for a new Alexander to be welcome there, and"
31,5035,Carthage was mindful of the fate that had befallen her mother city
31,5036,Tyre half a century before.  So she sent a fleet to encourage or
31,5037,"compel Rome to continue the struggle, and she cut the overseas"
31,5038,communications of Pyrrhus.  Pyrrhus found himself freshly assailed
31,5039,"by the Romans, and suffered a disastrous repulse in an attack he"
31,5040,had made upon their camp at Beneventum between Naples and Rome.
31,5042,And suddenly came news that recalled him to Epirus.  The Gauls
31,5043,were raiding south.  But this time they were not raiding down into
31,5044,"Italy; the Roman frontier, fortified and guarded, had become too"
31,5045,formidable for them.  They were raiding down through Illyria
31,5046,(which is now Serbia and Albania) to Macedonia and Epirus.
31,5047,"Repulsed by the Romans, endangered at sea by the Carthaginians,"
31,5048,"and threatened at home by the Gauls, Pyrrhus abandoned his dream"
31,5049,"of conquest and went home (275 B.C.), and the power of Rome was"
31,5050,extended to the Straits of Messina.
31,5052,"On the Sicilian side of the Straits was the Greek city of Messina,"
31,5053,and this presently fell into the hands of a gang of pirates.  The
31,5054,"Carthaginians, who were already practically overlords of Sicily"
31,5055,"and allies of Syracuse, suppressed these pirates (270 B.C.) and"
31,5056,put in a Carthaginian garrison there.  The pirates appealed to
31,5057,Rome and Rome listened to their complaint.  And so across the
31,5058,Straits of Messina the great trading power of Carthage and this
31,5059,"new conquering people, the Romans, found themselves in antagonism,"
31,5060,face to face.
32,5072,It was in 264 B.C. that the great struggle between Rome and
32,5073,"Carthage, the Punic Wars, began.  In that year Asoka was beginning"
32,5074,"his reign in Behar and Shi-Hwang-ti was a little child, the Museum"
32,5075,"in Alexandria was still doing good scientific work, and the"
32,5076,barbaric Gauls were now in Asia Minor and exacting a tribute from
32,5077,Pergamum.  The different regions of the world were still separated
32,5078,"by insurmountable distances, and probably the rest of mankind"
32,5079,heard only vague and remote rumours of the mortal fight that went
32,5080,"on for a century and a half in Spain, Italy, North Africa and the"
32,5081,"western Mediterranean, between the last stronghold of Semitic"
32,5082,"power and Rome, this newcomer among"
32,5083,Aryan-speaking peoples.
32,5085,That war has left its traces upon issues that still stir the
32,5086,"world.  Rome triumphed over Carthage, but the rivalry of Aryan and"
32,5087,Semite was to merge itself later on in the conflict of Gentile and
32,5088,Jew.  Our history now is coming to events whose consequences and
32,5089,distorted traditions still maintain a lingering and expiring
32,5090,"vitality in, and exercise a complicating and confusing influence"
32,5091,"upon, the conflicts and controversies of"
32,5092,to-day.
32,5094,The First Punic War began in 264 B.C. about the pirates of
32,5095,Messina.  It developed into a struggle for the possession of all
32,5096,Sicily except the dominions of the Greek king of Syracuse.  The
32,5097,advantage of the sea was at first with the Carthaginians.  They
32,5098,"had great fighting ships of what was hitherto an unheard-of size,"
32,5099,"quinqueremes, galleys with five banks of oars and a huge ram.  At"
32,5100,"the battle of Salamis, two centuries before, the leading"
32,5101,battleships had only been triremes with three banks.  But the
32,5102,"Romans, with extraordinary energy and in spite of the fact that"
32,5103,"they had little naval experience, set themselves to outbuild the"
32,5104,Carthaginians.  They manned the new navy they created chiefly with
32,5105,"Greek seamen, and they invented {181} grappling and boarding to"
32,5106,make up for the superior seamanship of the enemy.  When the
32,5107,"Carthaginian came up to ram or shear the oars of the Roman, huge"
32,5108,grappling irons seized him and the Roman soldiers swarmed aboard
32,5109,him.  At Mylae (260 B.C.) and at Ecnomus (256 B.C.) the
32,5110,Carthaginians were disastrously beaten.  They repulsed a Roman
32,5111,"landing near Carthage but were badly beaten at Palermo, losing one"
32,5112,hundred and four elephants there--to grace such a triumphal
32,5113,procession through the Forum as Rome had never seen before.  But
32,5114,after that came two Roman defeats and then a Roman recovery.  The
32,5115,last naval forces of Carthage were defeated {182} by it last Roman
32,5116,effort at the battle of the AEgatian Isles (241 B.C.) and Carthage
32,5117,"sued for peace.  All Sicily except the dominions of Hiero, king of"
32,5118,"Syracuse, was ceded to the Romans."
32,5122,For twenty-two years Rome and Carthage kept the peace.  Both had
32,5123,"trouble enough at home.  In Italy the Gauls came south again,"
32,5124,threatened Rome--which in a state of panic offered human
32,5125,_sacrifices to the Gods!_--and were routed at Telamon.  Rome
32,5126,"pushed forward to the Alps, and even extended her dominions down"
32,5127,the Adriatic coast to Illyria.  Carthage suffered from domestic
32,5128,"insurrections and from revolts in Corsica and Sardinia, and"
32,5129,"displayed far less recuperative power.  Finally, an act of"
32,5130,"intolerable aggression, Rome seized and annexed the two revolting"
32,5131,islands.
32,5133,Spain at that time was Carthaginian as far north as the river
32,5134,Ebro.  To that boundary the Romans restricted them.  Any crossing
32,5135,of the Ebro by the Carthaginians was to be considered an act of
32,5136,"war against the Romans.  At last in 218 B.C. the Carthaginians,"
32,5137,"provoked by new Roman aggressions, did cross this river under a"
32,5138,"young general named Hannibal, one of the most brilliant commanders"
32,5139,in the whole of history.  He marched his army from Spain over the
32,5140,"Alps into Italy, raised the Gauls against the Romans, and carried"
32,5141,on the Second Punic War in Italy itself for fifteen years.  He
32,5142,inflicted tremendous defeats upon the Romans at Lake Trasimere and
32,5143,"at Cannae, and throughout all his Italian campaigns no Roman army"
32,5144,stood against him and escaped disaster.  But a Roman army had
32,5145,landed at Marseilles and cut his communications with Spain; he had
32,5146,"no siege train, and he could never capture Rome.  Finally the"
32,5147,"Carthaginians, threatened by the revolt of the Numidians at home,"
32,5148,"were forced back upon the defence of their own city in Africa, a"
32,5149,"Roman army crossed into Africa, and Hannibal experienced his first"
32,5150,defeat under its walls at the battle of Zama (202 B.C.) at the
32,5151,hands of Scipio Africanus the Elder.  The battle of Zama ended
32,5152,this Second Punic War.  Carthage capitulated; she surrendered
32,5153,Spain and her war fleet; she paid an enormous indemnity and agreed
32,5154,to give up Hannibal to the vengeance of the Romans.  But Hannibal
32,5155,"escaped and fled to Asia where later, being in danger of falling"
32,5156,"into the hands of his relentless enemies, he took poison and died."
32,5160,For fifty-six years Rome and the shorn city of Carthage were at
32,5161,peace.  And meanwhile Rome spread her empire over confused and
32,5162,"divided Greece, invaded Asia Minor, and defeated Antiochus III,"
32,5163,"the Seleucid monarch, at Magnesia in Lydia.  She made Egypt, still"
32,5164,"under the Ptolemies, and Pergamum and most of the small states of"
32,5165,"Asia Minor into ""Allies,"" or, as we should call them now,"
32,5166,"""protected states."""
32,5168,"Meanwhile Carthage, subjugated and enfeebled, had been slowly"
32,5169,regaining something of her former prosperity.  Her recovery
32,5170,revived the hate and suspicion of the Romans.  She was attacked
32,5171,"upon the most shallow and artificial of quarrels (149 B.C.), she"
32,5172,"made an obstinate and bitter resistance, stood a long siege and"
32,5173,"was stormed (146 B.C.). The street fighting, or massacre, lasted"
32,5174,"six days; it was extraordinarily bloody, and when the citadel"
32,5175,capitulated only about fifty thousand of the Carthaginian
32,5176,population remained alive out of a quarter of a million.  They
32,5177,"were sold into slavery, and the city was burnt and elaborately"
32,5178,destroyed.  The blackened ruins were ploughed and sown as a sort
32,5179,of ceremonial effacement.
32,5184,So ended the Third Punic War.  Of all the Semitic states and
32,5185,cities that had flourished in the world five centuries before only
32,5186,one little country remained free under native rulers.  This was
32,5187,"Judea, which had liberated itself from the Seleucids and was under"
32,5188,the rule {184} of the native Maccabean princes.  By this time it
32,5189,"had its Bible almost complete, and was developing the distinctive"
32,5190,traditions of the Jewish world as we know it now.  It was natural
32,5191,"that the Carthaginians, Phoenicians and kindred peoples dispersed"
32,5192,about the world should find a common link in their practically
32,5193,identical language and in this literature of hope and courage.  To
32,5194,a large extent they were still the traders and bankers of the
32,5195,world.  The Semitic world had been submerged rather than replaced.
32,5197,"Jerusalem, which has always been rather the symbol than the centre"
32,5198,"of Judaism, was taken by the Romans in 65 B.C.; and after various"
32,5199,vicissitudes of quasi-independence and revolt was besieged by them
32,5200,in 70 A.D. and captured after a stubborn struggle.  The Temple was
32,5201,destroyed.  A later rebellion in 132 A.D. completed its
32,5202,"destruction, and the Jerusalem we know to-day was rebuilt later"
32,5203,"under Roman auspices.  A temple to the Roman god, Jupiter"
32,5204,"Capitolinus, stood in the place of the Temple, and Jews were"
32,5205,forbidden to inhabit the city.
33,5217,Now this new Roman power which arose to dominate the western world
33,5218,in the second and first centuries B.C. was in several respects a
33,5219,different thing from any of the great empires that had hitherto
33,5220,"prevailed in the civilized world.  It was not at first a monarchy,"
33,5221,and it was not the creation of any one great conqueror.  It was
33,5222,not indeed the first of republican empires; Athens had dominated a
33,5223,"group of Allies and dependents in the time of Pericles, and"
33,5224,Carthage when she entered upon her fatal struggle with Rome was
33,5225,"mistress of Sardinia and Corsica, Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and"
33,5226,most of Spain and Sicily.  But it was the first republican empire
33,5227,that escaped extinction and went on to fresh developments.
33,5229,The centre of this new system lay far to the west of the more
33,5230,"ancient centres of empire, which had hitherto been the river"
33,5231,valleys of Mesopotamia and Egypt.  This westward position enabled
33,5232,Rome to bring in to civilization quite fresh regions and peoples.
33,5233,"The Roman power extended to Morocco and Spain, and was presently"
33,5234,able to thrust north-westward over what is now France and Belgium
33,5235,to Britain and north-eastward into Hungary and South Russia.  But
33,5236,on the other hand it was never able to maintain itself in Central
33,5237,Asia or Persia because they were too far from its administrative
33,5238,centres.  It included therefore great masses of fresh Nordic
33,5239,"Aryan-speaking peoples, it presently incorporated nearly all the"
33,5240,"Greek people in the world, and its population was less strongly"
33,5241,Hamitic and Semitic than that of any preceding empire.
33,5243,For some centuries this Roman Empire did not fall into the grooves
33,5244,"of precedent that had so speedily swallowed up Persian and Greek,"
33,5245,and all that time it developed.  The rulers of the Medes and
33,5246,Persians became entirely Babylonized in a generation or so; they
33,5247,{186} took over the tiara of the king of kings and the temples and
33,5248,priesthoods of his gods; Alexander and his successors followed in
33,5249,the same easy path of assimilation; the Seleucid monarchs had much
33,5250,the same court and administrative methods as Nebuchadnezzar; the
33,5251,Ptolemies became Pharaohs and altogether Egyptian.  They were
33,5252,assimilated just as before them the Semitic conquerors of the
33,5253,Sumerians had been assimilated.  But the Romans ruled in their own
33,5254,"city, and for some centuries kept to the laws of their own nature."
33,5255,The only people who exercised any great mental influence upon them
33,5256,before the second or third century A.D. were the kindred and
33,5257,similar Greeks.  So that the Roman Empire was essentially a first
33,5258,attempt to rule a great dominion upon mainly Aryan lines.  It was
33,5259,"so far a new pattern in history, it was an expanded Aryan"
33,5260,republic.  The old pattern of a personal conqueror ruling over a
33,5261,capital city that had grown up round the temple of a harvest god
33,5262,"did not apply to it.  The Romans had gods and temples, but like"
33,5263,"the gods of the Greeks their gods were quasi-human immortals,"
33,5264,divine patricians.  The Romans also had blood sacrifices and even
33,5265,"made human ones in times of stress, things they may have learnt to"
33,5266,do from their dusky Etruscan teachers; but until Rome was long
33,5267,past its zenith neither priest nor temple played a large part in
33,5268,Roman history.
33,5270,"The Roman Empire was a growth, an unplanned novel growth; the"
33,5271,Roman people found themselves engaged almost unawares in a vast
33,5272,administrative experiment.  It cannot be called a successful
33,5273,experiment.  In the end their empire collapsed altogether.  And it
33,5274,changed enormously in form and method from century to century.  It
33,5275,changed more in a hundred years than Bengal or Mesopotamia or
33,5276,Egypt changed in a thousand.  It was always changing.  It never
33,5277,attained to any fixity.
33,5279,In a sense the experiment failed.  In a sense the experiment
33,5280,"remains unfinished, and Europe and America to-day are still"
33,5281,working out the riddles of world-wide statescraft first confronted
33,5282,by the Roman people.
33,5284,It is well for the student of history to bear in mind the very
33,5285,great changes not only in political but in social and moral
33,5286,matters that went on throughout the period of Roman dominion.
33,5287,There is much too strong a tendency in people's minds to think of
33,5288,"the Roman {187} rule as something finished and stable, firm,"
33,5289,"rounded, noble and decisive.  Macaulay's _Lays of Ancient Rome_,"
33,5290,"S.P.Q.R. the elder Cato, the Scipios, Julius Caesar, Diocletian,"
33,5291,"Constantine the Great, triumphs, orations, gladiatorial combats"
33,5292,and Christian martyrs are all mixed up together in a picture of
33,5293,something high and cruel and dignified.  The items of that picture
33,5294,have to be disentangled.  They are collected at different points
33,5295,from a process of change profounder than that which separates the
33,5296,London of William the Conqueror from the London of to-day.
33,5298,We may very conveniently divide the expansion of Rome into four
33,5299,stages.  The first stage began after the sack of Rome by the Goths
33,5300,in 390 B.C. and went on until the end of the First Punic War (240
33,5301,B.C.).  We may call this stage the stage of the Assimilative
33,5302,"Republic.  It was perhaps the finest, most characteristic stage in"
33,5303,Roman history.  The age-long dissensions of patrician and plebeian
33,5304,"were drawing to it close, the Etruscan threat had come to an end,"
33,5305,"no one was very rich yet nor very poor, and most men were"
33,5306,public-spirited.  It was a republic like the republic of the
33,5307,South African Boers before 1900 or like the northern states of the
33,5308,American union between 1800 and 1850; a free-farmers republic.  At
33,5309,the outset of this stage Rome was a little state scarcely twenty
33,5310,"miles square.  She fought the sturdy but kindred states about her,"
33,5311,and sought not their destruction but coalescence.  Her centuries
33,5312,of civil dissension had trained her people in compromise and
33,5313,concessions.  Some of the defeated cities became altogether Roman
33,5314,"with a voting share in the government, some became self-governing"
33,5315,with the right to trade and marry in Rome; garrisons full of
33,5316,citizens were set up at strategic points and colonies of varied
33,5317,privileges founded among the freshly conquered people.  Great
33,5318,roads were made.  The rapid Latinization of all Italy was the
33,5319,inevitable consequence of such a policy.  In 89 B.C. all the free
33,5320,inhabitants of Italy became citizens of the city of Rome.
33,5321,Formally the whole Roman Empire became at last an extended city.
33,5322,In 212 A.D. every free man in the entire extent of the empire was
33,5323,"given citizenship; the right, if he could get there, to vote in"
33,5324,the town meeting in Rome.
33,5326,This extension of citizenship to tractable cities and to whole
33,5327,countries was the distinctive device of Roman expansion.  It {188}
33,5328,reversed the old process of conquest and assimilation altogether.
33,5329,By the Roman method the conquerors assimilated the conquered.
33,5333,"But after the First Punic War and the annexation of Sicily, though"
33,5334,"the old process of assimilation still went on, another process"
33,5335,arose by its side.  Sicily for instance was treated as a conquered
33,5336,"prey.  It was declared an ""estate"" of the Roman people.  Its rich"
33,5337,soil and industrious population was exploited to make Rome rich.
33,5338,The patricians and the more influential among the plebeians
33,5339,secured the major share of that wealth.  And the war also brought
33,5340,in a large supply of slaves.  Before the First Punic War the
33,5341,population of the republic had been largely a population of
33,5342,citizen farmers.  Military service was their privilege and
33,5343,liability.  While they were on active service their farms fell
33,5344,into debt and a new large-scale slave agriculture grew up; when
33,5345,they returned they found their produce in competition with
33,5346,slave-grown produce from Sicily and from the new estates at home.
33,5347,Times had changed.  The republic had {189} altered its character.
33,5348,"Not only was Sicily in the hands of Rome, the common man was in"
33,5349,the hands of the rich creditor and the rich competitor.  Rome had
33,5350,"entered upon its second stage, the Republic of Adventurous Rich"
33,5351,Men.
33,5355,For two hundred years the Roman soldier farmers had struggled for
33,5356,freedom and a share in the government of their state; for a
33,5357,hundred years they had enjoyed their privileges.  The First Punic
33,5358,War wasted them and robbed them of all they had won.
33,5360,The value of their electoral privileges had also evaporated.  The
33,5361,governing bodies of the Roman republic were two in number.  The
33,5362,first and more important was the Senate.  This was a body
33,5363,"originally of patricians and then of prominent men of all sorts,"
33,5364,"who were summoned to it first by certain powerful officials, the"
33,5365,consuls and censors.  Like the British House of Lords it became a
33,5366,"gathering of great landowners, prominent politicians, big business"
33,5367,men and the {190} like.  It was much more like the British House
33,5368,of Lords than it was like the American Senate.  For three
33,5369,"centuries, from the Punic Wars onward, it was the centre of Roman"
33,5370,political thought and purpose.  The second body was the Popular
33,5371,Assembly.  This was supposed to be an assembly of _all_ the
33,5372,citizens of Rome.  When Rome was a little state twenty miles
33,5373,square this was a possible gathering.  When the citizenship of
33,5374,"Rome had spread beyond the confines in Italy, it was an altogether"
33,5375,"impossible one.  Its meetings, proclaimed by"
33,5376,"horn-blowing from the Capitol and the city walls, became more and"
33,5377,more a gathering of political hacks and city riff-raff.  In the
33,5378,fourth century B.C. the Popular Assembly was a considerable check
33,5379,"upon the Senate, a competent representation of the claims and"
33,5380,rights of the common man.  By the end of the Punic Wars it was an
33,5381,impotent relic of a vanquished popular control.  No effectual
33,5382,legal check remained upon the big men.
33,5386,Nothing of the nature of representative government was ever
33,5387,introduced into the Roman republic.  No one thought of electing
33,5388,delegates to represent the will of the citizens.  This is a very
33,5389,important point for the student to grasp.  The Popular Assembly
33,5390,{191} never became the equivalent of the American House of
33,5391,Representatives or the British House of Commons.  In theory it was
33,5392,all the citizens; in practice it ceased to be anything at all
33,5393,worth consideration.
33,5395,The common citizen of the Roman Empire was therefore in a very
33,5396,"poor case after the Second Punic War; he was impoverished, he had"
33,5397,"often lost his farm, he was ousted from profitable production by"
33,5398,"slaves, and he had no political power left to him to remedy these"
33,5399,things.  The only methods of popular expression left to a people
33,5400,without any form of political expression are the strike and the
33,5401,"revolt.  The story of the second and first centuries B.C., so far"
33,5402,"as internal politics go, is a story of futile revolutionary"
33,5403,upheaval.  The scale of this history will not permit us to tell of
33,5404,"the intricate struggles of that time, of the attempts to break up"
33,5405,"estates and restore the land to the free farmer, of proposals to"
33,5406,abolish debts in whole or in part.  There was revolt and civil
33,5407,"war.  In 73 B.C., the distresses of Italy were enhanced by a great"
33,5408,"insurrection, of the slaves under Spartacus.  The slaves of Italy"
33,5409,"revolted with some effect, for among them were the trained"
33,5410,fighters of the gladiatorial shows.  For two years Spartacus held
33,5411,"out in the crater of Vesuvius, which seemed at that time to be an"
33,5412,extinct volcano.  This insurrection was defeated at last and
33,5413,suppressed with frantic cruelty.  Six thousand captured
33,5414,"Spartacists were crucified along the Appian Way, the great highway"
33,5415,that runs southward out of Rome (71 B.C.).
33,5417,The common man never made head against the forces that were
33,5418,subjugating and degrading him.  But the big rich men who were
33,5419,overcoming him were even in his defeat preparing a new power in
33,5420,"the Roman world over themselves and him, the power of the army."
33,5422,Before the Second Punic War the army of Rome was a levy of free
33,5423,"farmers, who, according to their quality, rode or marched afoot to"
33,5424,"battle.  This was a very good force for wars close at hand, but"
33,5425,not the sort of army that will go abroad and bear long campaigns
33,5426,with patience.  And moreover as the slaves multiplied and the
33,5427,"estates grew, the supply of free-spirited fighting farmers"
33,5428,declined.  It was a popular leader named Marius who introduced a
33,5429,new factor.  North Africa after the overthrow of the Carthaginian
33,5430,"civilization had become a semi-barbaric kingdom, the kingdom of"
33,5431,"Numidia.  {192} The Roman power fell into conflict with Jugurtha,"
33,5432,"king of this state, and experienced enormous difficulties in"
33,5433,"subduing him.  Marius was made consul, in a phase of public"
33,5434,"indignation, to end this discreditable war.  This he did by"
33,5435,raising _paid troops_ and drilling them hard.  Jugurtha was
33,5436,"brought in chains to Rome (106 B.C.) and Marius, when his time of"
33,5437,"office had expired, held on to his consulship illegally with his"
33,5438,newly created legions.  There was no power in Rome to restrain
33,5439,him.
33,5441,With Marius began the third phase in the development of the Roman
33,5442,"power, the Republic of the Military Commanders.  For now began a"
33,5443,period in which the leaders of the paid legions fought for the
33,5444,mastery of the Roman world.  Against Marius was pitted the
33,5445,aristocratic Sulla who had served under him in Africa.  Each in
33,5446,turn made a great massacre of his political opponents.  Men were
33,5447,"proscribed and executed by the thousand, and their estates were"
33,5448,sold.  After the bloody rivalry of these two and the horror of the
33,5449,"revolt of Spartacus, came a phase in which Lucullus and Pompey the"
33,5450,Great and Crassus and Julius Caesar were the masters of armies and
33,5451,dominated affairs.  It was Crassus who defeated Spartacus.
33,5452,"Lucullus conquered Asia Minor and penetrated to Armenia, and"
33,5453,retired with great wealth into private life.  Crassus thrusting
33,5454,further invaded Persia and was defeated and slain by the
33,5455,Parthians.  After a long rivalry Pompey was defeated by Julius
33,5456,"Caesar (48 B.C.) and murdered in Egypt, leaving Julius Caesar sole"
33,5457,master of the Roman world.
33,5459,The figure of Julius Caesar is one that has stirred the human
33,5460,imagination out of all proportion to its merit or true importance.
33,5461,He has become a legend and a symbol.  For us he is chiefly
33,5462,important as marking the transition from the phase of military
33,5463,adventurers to the beginning of the fourth stage in Roman
33,5464,"expansion, the Early Empire.  For in spite of the profoundest"
33,5465,"economic and political convulsions, in spite of civil war and"
33,5466,"social degeneration, throughout all this time the boundaries of"
33,5467,the Roman state crept outward and continued to creep outward to
33,5468,their maximum about 100 A.D.  There had been something like an ebb
33,5469,"during the doubtful phases of the Second Punic War, and again a"
33,5470,manifest loss of vigour before the reconstruction of the army by
33,5471,Marius. The revolt of Spartacus {193} marked a third phase.
33,5472,"Julius Caesar made his reputation as a military leader in Gaul,"
33,5473,which is now France and Belgium.  (The chief tribes inhabiting
33,5474,this country belonged to the same Celtic people as the Gauls who
33,5475,"had occupied north Italy for a time, and who had afterwards raided"
33,5476,into Asia Minor and settled down as the Galatians.)  Caesar drove
33,5477,back a German invasion of Gaul and added all that country to the
33,5478,"empire, and he twice crossed the Straits of Dover into Britain (55"
33,5479,"and 54 B.C.), where however he made no permanent conquest."
33,5480,Meanwhile Pompey the Great was consolidating Roman conquests that
33,5481,reached in the east to the Caspian Sea.
33,5485,"At this time, the middle of the first century B.C., the Roman"
33,5486,"Senate was still the nominal centre of the Roman government,"
33,5487,"appointing consuls and other officials, granting powers and the"
33,5488,"like; and a number of politicians, among whom Cicero was an"
33,5489,"outstanding {194} figure, were struggling to preserve the great"
33,5490,traditions of republican Rome and to maintain respect for its
33,5491,laws.  But the spirit of citizenship had gone from Italy with the
33,5492,wasting away of the free farmers; it was a land now of slaves and
33,5493,impoverished men with neither the understanding nor the desire for
33,5494,freedom.  There was nothing whatever behind these republican
33,5495,"leaders in the Senate, while behind the great adventurers they"
33,5496,feared and desired to control were the legions.  Over the heads of
33,5497,the Senate Crassus and Pompey and Caesar divided the rule of the
33,5498,Empire between them (The First Triumvirate).  When presently
33,5499,"Crassus was killed at distant Carrhae by the Parthians, Pompey and"
33,5500,"Caesar fell out.  Pompey took up the republican side, and laws were"
33,5501,passed to bring Caesar to trial for his breaches of law and his
33,5502,disobedience to the decrees of the Senate.
33,5504,It was illegal for a general to bring his troops out of the
33,5505,"boundary of his command, and the boundary between Caesar's command"
33,5506,"and Italy was the Rubicon.  In 49 B.C. he crossed the Rubicon,"
33,5507,"saying ""The die is cast"" and marched upon Pompey and Rome."
33,5509,"It had been the custom in Rome in the past, in periods of military"
33,5510,"extremity, to elect a ""dictator"" with practically unlimited powers"
33,5511,"to rule through the crisis.  After his overthrow of Pompey, Caesar"
33,5512,was made dictator first for ten years and then (in 45 B.C.) for
33,5513,life.  In effect he was made monarch of the empire for life.
33,5514,"There was talk of a king, a word abhorrent to Rome since the"
33,5515,expulsion of the Etruscans five centuries before.  Caesar refused
33,5516,"to be king, but adopted throne and sceptre.  After his defeat of"
33,5517,"Pompey, Caesar had gone on into Egypt and had made love to"
33,5518,"Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, the goddess queen of Egypt."
33,5519,She seems to have turned his head very completely.  He had brought
33,5520,back to Rome the Egyptian idea of a god-king.  His statue was set
33,5521,"up in a temple with an inscription ""To the Unconquerable God."""
33,5522,"The expiring republicanism of Rome flared up in a last protest,"
33,5523,and Caesar was stabbed to death in the Senate at the foot of the
33,5524,"statue of his murdered rival, Pompey the Great."
33,5526,Thirteen years more of this conflict of ambitious personalities
33,5527,"followed.  There was a second Triumvirate of Lepidus, Mark Antony"
33,5528,"and Octavian Caesar, the latter the nephew of Julius Caesar."
33,5529,"Octavian like his uncle took the poorer, hardier western provinces"
33,5530,"{195} where the best legions were recruited.  In 31 B.C., he"
33,5531,"defeated Mark Antony, his only serious rival, at the naval battle"
33,5532,"of Actium, and made himself sole master of the Roman world.  But"
33,5533,Octavian was a man of different quality altogether from Julius
33,5534,Caesar.  He had no foolish craving to be God or King.  He had no
33,5535,queen-lover that he wished to dazzle.  He restored freedom to the
33,5536,Senate and people of Rome.  He declined to be dictator.  The
33,5537,grateful Senate in return gave him the reality instead of the
33,5538,"forms of power.  He was to be called not King indeed, but"
33,5539,"""Princeps"" and ""Augustus.""  He became Augustus Caesar, the first of"
33,5540,the Roman emperors (27 B.C. to 14 A.D.).
33,5542,He was followed by Tiberius Caesar (14 to 37 A.D.) and he by
33,5543,"others, Caligula, Claudius, Nero and so on up to Trajan (98 A.D.),"
33,5544,"Hadrian (117 A.D.), Antonius Pius (138 A.D.) and Marcus Aurelius"
33,5545,(161-180 A.D.).  All these emperors were emperors of the legions.
33,5546,"The soldiers made them, and some the soldiers destroyed."
33,5547,"Gradually the Senate fades out of Roman-history, and the emperor"
33,5548,and his administrative officials replace it.  The boundaries of
33,5549,the empire crept forward now to their utmost limits.  Most of
33,5550,"Britain was added to the empire, Transylvania was brought in as a"
33,5551,"new province, Dacia; Trajan crossed the Euphrates.  Hadrian had an"
33,5552,idea that reminds us at once of what had happened at the other end
33,5553,of the old world.  Like Shi-Hwang-ti he built walls against the
33,5554,northern barbarians; one across Britain and a palisade between the
33,5555,Rhine and the Danube.  He abandoned some of the acquisitions of
33,5556,Trajan.
33,5558,The expansion of the Roman Empire was at an end.
34,5570,The second and first centuries B.C. mark a new phase in the
34,5571,history of mankind.  Mesopotamia and the eastern Mediterranean are
34,5572,no longer the centre of interest.  Both Mesopotamia and Egypt were
34,5573,"still fertile, populous and fairly prosperous, but they were no"
34,5574,longer the dominant regions of the world.  Power had drifted to
34,5575,the west and to the east.  Two great empires now dominated the
34,5576,"world, this new Roman Empire and the renascent Empire of China."
34,5577,"Rome extended its power to the Euphrates, but it was never able to"
34,5578,get beyond that boundary.  It was too remote.  Beyond the
34,5579,Euphrates the former Persian and Indian dominions of the Seleucids
34,5580,"fell under a number of new masters.  China, now under the Han"
34,5581,"dynasty, which had replaced the Ts'in dynasty at the death of"
34,5582,"Shi-Hwang-ti, had extended its power across Tibet and over the"
34,5583,high mountain passes of the Pamirs into western Turkestan.  But
34,5584,"there, too, it reached its extremes.  Beyond was too far."
34,5586,"China at this time was the greatest, best organized and most"
34,5587,civilized political system in the world.  It was superior in area
34,5588,and population to the Roman Empire at its zenith.  It was possible
34,5589,then for these two vast systems to flourish in the same world at
34,5590,the same time in almost complete ignorance of each other.  The
34,5591,means of communication both by sea and land was not yet
34,5592,sufficiently developed and organized for them to come to a direct
34,5593,clash.
34,5595,"Yet they reacted upon each other in a very remarkable way, and"
34,5596,their influence upon the fate of the regions that lay between
34,5597,"them, upon central Asia and India, was profound.  A certain amount"
34,5598,"of trade trickled through, by camel caravans across Persia, for"
34,5599,"example, and by coasting ships by way of India and the Red Sea."
34,5600,In 66 B.C. Roman troops under Pompey followed in the footsteps of
34,5601,"Alexander the Great, and marched up the eastern shores of the"
34,5602,{197} Caspian Sea.  In 102 A.D. a Chinese expeditionary force
34,5603,"under Pan Chau reached the Caspian, and sent emissaries to report"
34,5604,upon the power of Rome.  But many centuries were still to pass
34,5605,before definite knowledge and direct intercourse were to link the
34,5606,great parallel worlds of Europe and Eastern Asia.
34,5608,To the north of both these great empires were barbaric
34,5609,wildernesses.  What is now Germany was largely forest lands; the
34,5610,forests extended far into Russia and made a home for the gigantic
34,5611,"aurochs, a bull of almost elephantine size.  Then to the north of"
34,5612,"the great mountain masses of Asia stretched a band of deserts,"
34,5613,steppes and then forests and frozen lands.  In the eastward lap of
34,5614,the elevated part of Asia was the great triangle of Manchuria.
34,5615,"Large parts of these regions, stretching between South Russia and"
34,5616,"Turkestan into Manchuria, were and are regions of exceptional"
34,5617,climatic insecurity.  Their rainfall has varied greatly in the
34,5618,course of a few centuries  They are lands treacherous to man.  For
34,5619,"years they will carry pasture and sustain cultivation, and then"
34,5620,will come an age of decline in humidity and a cycle of killing
34,5621,droughts.
34,5625,The western part of this barbaric north from the German forests to
34,5626,South Russia and Turkestan and from Gothland to the Alps was the
34,5627,region of origin of the Nordic peoples and of the Aryan speech.
34,5628,The eastern steppes and deserts of Mongolia was the region of
34,5629,origin of the Hunnish or Mongolian or Tartar or Turkish
34,5630,"peoples--for all these several peoples were akin in language, race,"
34,5631,and way of life.  And as the Nordic peoples seem to have been
34,5632,continually overflowing their own borders and pressing south upon
34,5633,the developing civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean
34,5634,"coast, so the Hunnish {198} tribes sent their surplus as"
34,5635,"wanderers, raiders and conquerors into the settled regions of"
34,5636,China.  Periods of plenty in the north would mean an increase in
34,5637,"population there; a shortage of grass, a spell of cattle disease,"
34,5638,would drive the hungry warlike tribesmen south.
34,5642,For a time there were simultaneously two fairly effective Empires
34,5643,in the world capable of holding back the barbarians and even
34,5644,forcing forward the frontiers of the imperial peace.  The thrust
34,5645,of the Han empire from north China into Mongolia was strong and
34,5646,continuous.  The Chinese population welled up over the barrier of
34,5647,the Great Wall.  Behind the imperial frontier guards came the
34,5648,"Chinese farmer with horse and plough, ploughing up the grass lands"
34,5649,and enclosing the winter pasture.  The Hunnish peoples raided and
34,5650,"murdered the settlers, but the Chinese punitive expeditions were"
34,5651,too much for them.  The nomads were faced with the choice of
34,5652,settling down to the plough and becoming Chinese tax-payers or
34,5653,shifting in search of fresh summer pastures.  Some took the former
34,5654,course and were absorbed.  Some drifted
34,5655,north-eastward and eastward over the mountain passes down into
34,5656,western Turkestan.
34,5658,This westward drive of the Mongolian horsemen was going on from
34,5659,200 B.C. onward.  It was producing a westward pressure upon the
34,5660,"Aryan tribes, and these again were pressing upon the Roman"
34,5661,frontiers ready to break through directly there was any weakness
34,5662,"apparent.  The Parthians, who were apparently a Scythian people"
34,5663,"with some Mongolian admixture, came down to the Euphrates by the"
34,5664,first century B.C.  They fought against Pompey the Great in {199}
34,5665,his eastern raid.  They defeated and killed Crassus.  They
34,5666,replaced the Seleucid monarchy in Persia by a dynasty of Parthian
34,5667,"kings, the Arsacid dynasty."
34,5671,But for a time the line of least resistance for hungry nomads lay
34,5672,neither to the west nor the east but through central Asia and then
34,5673,south-eastward through the Khyber Pass into India.  It was India
34,5674,which received the Mongolian drive in these centuries of Roman and
34,5675,Chinese strength.  A series of raiding conquerors poured down
34,5676,through the Punjab into the great plains to loot and destroy.  The
34,5677,"empire of Asoka was broken up, and for a time the history of India"
34,5678,passes into darkness.  A certain Kushan dynasty founded by the
34,5679,"""Indo-Scythians""--one of the raiding peoples--ruled for a time"
34,5680,over North India and maintained a certain order.  These invasions
34,5681,went on for several centuries.  For a large part of the fifth
34,5682,"century A.D. India was afflicted by the Ephthalites or White Huns,"
34,5683,who levied tribute on the small Indian princes and held India in
34,5684,terror.  Every summer these Ephthalites pastured in western
34,5685,"Turkestan, every autumn they came down through the passes to"
34,5686,terrorize India.
34,5690,In the second century A.D. a great misfortune came upon the Roman
34,5691,and Chinese empires that probably weakened the resistance of both
34,5692,to barbarian pressure.  This was a pestilence of unexampled
34,5693,virulence.  It raged for eleven years in China and disorganized
34,5694,"the social framework profoundly.  The Han dynasty fell, and a new"
34,5695,age of division and confusion began from which China did not
34,5696,fairly recover until the seventh century A.D. with the coming of
34,5697,the great Tang dynasty.
34,5699,The infection spread through Asia to Europe.  It raged throughout
34,5700,the Roman Empire from 164 to 180 A.D.  It evidently weakened the
34,5701,Roman imperial fabric very seriously.  We begin to hear of
34,5702,"depopulation in the Roman provinces after this, and there was a"
34,5703,marked deterioration in the vigour and efficiency of government.
34,5704,"At any rate we presently find the frontier no longer invulnerable,"
34,5705,but giving way first in this place and then in that.  A new Nordic
34,5706,"people, the Goths, coming originally from Gothland in Sweden, had"
34,5707,migrated across Russia to the Volga region and the shores of the
34,5708,Black Sea and taken to the sea and piracy.  By the end of the
34,5709,second century they may have begun to feel the westward thrust of
34,5710,"the Huns.  In 247 they crossed the Danube in a great land raid,"
34,5711,and defeated and killed the Emperor Decius in a battle in what is
34,5712,"now Serbia. In 236 another Germanic people, the Franks, had broken"
34,5713,"bounds upon the lower Rhine, and the Alemanni had poured into"
34,5714,"Alsace.  The legions in Gaul beat back their invaders, but the"
34,5715,Goths in the Balkan peninsula raided again and again.  The
34,5716,province of Dacia vanished from Roman history.
34,5718,A chill had come to the pride and confidence of Rome.  In 270-275
34,5719,"Rome, which had been an open and secure city for three centuries,"
34,5720,was fortified by the Emperor Aurelian.
35,5732,Before we tell of how this Roman empire which was built up in the
35,5733,"two centuries B.C., and which flourished in peace and security"
35,5734,"from the days of Augustus Caesar onward for two centuries, fell"
35,5735,"into disorder and was broken up, it may be as well to devote some"
35,5736,attention to the life of the ordinary people throughout this great
35,5737,realm.  Our history has come down now to within 2000 years of our
35,5738,"own time; and the life of the civilized people, both under the"
35,5739,"Peace of Rome and the Peace of the Han dynasty, was beginning to"
35,5740,resemble more and more clearly the life of their civilized
35,5741,successors to-day.
35,5743,In the western world coined money was now in common use; outside
35,5744,the priestly world there were many people of independent means who
35,5745,were neither officials of the government nor priests; people
35,5746,"travelled about more freely than they had ever done before, and"
35,5747,"there were high roads and inns for them.  Compared with the past,"
35,5748,"with the time before 500 B.C., life had become much more loose."
35,5749,Before that date civilized men had been bound to a district or
35,5750,"country, had been bound to a tradition and lived within a very"
35,5751,limited horizon; only the nomads traded and travelled.
35,5753,But neither the Roman Peace nor the Peace of the Han dynasty meant
35,5754,a uniform civilization over the large areas they controlled.
35,5755,There were very great local differences and great contrasts and
35,5756,"inequalities of culture between one district and another, just as"
35,5757,there are to-day under the British Peace in India.  The Roman
35,5758,garrisons and colonies were dotted here and there over this great
35,5759,"space, worshipping Roman gods and speaking the Latin language; but"
35,5760,where there had been towns and cities before the coming of the
35,5761,"Romans, they went on, subordinated indeed but managing their own"
35,5762,"affairs, and, for a time at least, worshipping their own gods in"
35,5763,"their own fashion.  Over Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt and the"
35,5764,"Hellenized East {202} generally, the Latin language never"
35,5765,"prevailed.  Greek ruled there invincibly.  Saul of Tarsus, who"
35,5766,"became the apostle Paul, was a Jew and a Roman citizen; but he"
35,5767,spoke and wrote Greek and not Hebrew.  Even at the court of the
35,5768,"Parthian dynasty, which had overthrown the Greek Seleucids in"
35,5769,"Persia, and was quite outside the Roman imperial boundaries, Greek"
35,5770,was the fashionable language.  In some parts of Spain and in North
35,5771,"Africa, the Carthaginian language also held on for a long time in"
35,5772,"spite of the destruction of Carthage.  Such a town as Seville, which"
35,5773,had been a prosperous city long before the Roman name had been heard
35,5774,"of, kept its Semitic goddess and preserved its Semitic speech for"
35,5775,"generations, in spite of a colony of Roman veterans at Italica a few"
35,5776,"miles away.  Septimius Severus, who was emperor from 193 to 211"
35,5777,"A.D., spoke Carthaginian as his mother speech.  He learnt Latin"
35,5778,later as a foreign tongue; {203} and it is recorded that his sister
35,5779,never learnt Latin and conducted her Roman household in the
35,5780,Punic language.
35,5784,In such countries as Gaul and Britain and in provinces like Dacia
35,5785,"(now roughly Roumania) and Pannonia (Hungary south of the Danube),"
35,5786,where there were no pre-existing great cities and temples and
35,5787,"cultures, the Roman empire did however ""Latinize.""  It civilized"
35,5788,these countries for the first time.  It created cities and towns
35,5789,"where Latin was from the first the dominant speech, and where"
35,5790,Roman gods were served and Roman customs and fashions followed.
35,5791,"The Roumanian, Italian, French and Spanish languages, all"
35,5792,"variations and modifications of Latin, remain to remind us of this"
35,5793,extension of Latin speech and customs.
35,5794,North-west Africa also became at last largely Latin-speaking.
35,5795,"Egypt, Greece and the rest of the empire to the east were never"
35,5796,Latinized.  They remained Egyptian and Greek in culture and
35,5797,"spirit.  And even in Rome, among educated men, Greek was learnt as"
35,5798,the language of a gentleman and Greek literature and learning were
35,5799,"very, properly preferred to Latin."
35,5801,In this miscellaneous empire the ways of doing work and business
35,5802,were naturally also very miscellaneous.  The chief industry of the
35,5803,settled world was still largely agriculture.  We have told how in
35,5804,Italy the sturdy free farmers who were the backbone of the early
35,5805,Roman republic were replaced by estates worked by slave labour
35,5806,after the Punic wars.  The Greek world had had very various
35,5807,"methods of cultivation, from the Arcadian plan, wherein every free"
35,5808,"citizen toiled with his own hands, to Sparta, wherein it was a"
35,5809,dishonour to work and where agricultural work was done by a
35,5810,"special slave class, the Helots.  But that was ancient history"
35,5811,"now, and over most of the Hellenized world the estate system and"
35,5812,slave-gangs had spread.  The agricultural slaves were captives who
35,5813,spoke many different languages so that they could not understand
35,5814,"each other, or they were born slaves; they had no solidarity to"
35,5815,"resist oppression, no tradition of rights, no knowledge, for they"
35,5816,could not read nor write.  Although they came to form a majority
35,5817,of the country population they never made a successful
35,5818,insurrection.  The insurrection of Spartacus in the first century
35,5819,B.C. was an insurrection of the special slaves who were trained
35,5820,for the gladiatorial combats. The agricultural workers in Italy in
35,5821,the latter days of {204} the Republic and the early Empire
35,5822,suffered frightful indignities; they would be chained at night to
35,5823,prevent escape or have half the head shaved to make it difficult.
35,5824,"They had no wives of their own; they could be outraged, mutilated"
35,5825,and killed by their masters.  A master could sell his slave to
35,5826,"fight beasts in the arena.  If a slave slew his master, all the"
35,5827,slaves in his household and not merely the murderer were
35,5828,"crucified.  In some parts of Greece, in Athens notably, the lot of"
35,5829,"the slave was never quite so frightful as this, but it was still"
35,5830,detestable.  To such a population the barbarian invaders who
35,5831,"presently broke through the defensive line of the legions, came"
35,5832,not as enemies but as liberators.
35,5836,The slave system had spread to most industries and to every sort
35,5837,of work that could be done by gangs.  Mines and metallurgical
35,5838,"operations, the rowing of galleys, road-making and big building"
35,5839,operations were all largely slave occupations.  And almost all
35,5840,domestic service was performed by slaves.  There were poor
35,5841,free-men {205} and there were freed-men in the cities and upon the
35,5842,"country side, working for themselves or even working for wages."
35,5843,"They were artizans, supervisors and so forth, workers of a new"
35,5844,money-paid class working in competition with slave workers; but we
35,5845,do not know what proportion they made of the general population.
35,5846,It probably varied widely in different places and at different
35,5847,"periods.  And there were also many modifications of slavery, from"
35,5848,the slavery that was chained at night and driven with whips to the
35,5849,"farm or quarry, to the slave whose master found it advantageous to"
35,5850,leave him to cultivate his patch or work his craft and own his
35,5851,"wife like a free-man, provided he paid in a satisfactory quittance"
35,5852,to his owner.
35,5854,There were armed slaves.  At the opening of the period of the
35,5855,"Punic wars, in 264 B.C., the Etruscan sport of setting slaves to"
35,5856,fight for their lives was revived in Rome.  It grew rapidly
35,5857,fashionable; and soon every great Roman rich man kept a retinue of
35,5858,"gladiators, who sometimes fought in the arena but whose real"
35,5859,business it was to act as his bodyguard of bullies.  And also
35,5860,there were learned slaves.  The conquests of the later Republic
35,5861,"were among the highly civilized cities of Greece, North Africa and"
35,5862,Asia Minor; and they brought in many highly educated captives.
35,5863,The tutor of a young Roman of good family was usually a slave.  A
35,5864,"rich man would have a Greek slave as librarian, and slave"
35,5865,secretaries and learned men.  He would keep his poet as he would
35,5866,keep a performing dog.  In this atmosphere of slavery the
35,5867,traditions of modern literary criticism were evolved.  The slaves
35,5868,still boast and quarrel in our reviews.  There were enterprising
35,5869,people who bought intelligent boy slaves and had them educated for
35,5870,"sale.  Slaves were trained as book copyists, as jewellers, and for"
35,5871,endless skilled callings.
35,5873,But there were very considerable changes in the position of a
35,5874,slave during the four hundred years between the opening days of
35,5875,conquest under the republic of rich men and the days of
35,5876,disintegration that followed the great pestilence.  In the second
35,5877,"century B.C. war-captives were abundant, manners gross and brutal;"
35,5878,the slave had no rights and there was scarcely an outrage the
35,5879,reader can imagine that was not practised upon slaves in those
35,5880,days.  But already in the first century A.D. there was a
35,5881,perceptible improvement in the attitude of the Roman civilization
35,5882,"towards slavery.  Captives were not so abundant for one thing,"
35,5883,"{207} thing, and slaves were dearer.  And slave-owners began to"
35,5884,realize that the profit and comfort they got from their slaves
35,5885,increased with the self-respect of these unfortunates.  But also
35,5886,"the moral tone of the community was rising, and a sense of justice"
35,5887,was becoming effective.  The higher mentality of Greece was
35,5888,qualifying the old Roman harshness.  Restrictions upon cruelty
35,5889,"were made, a master might no longer sell his slave to fight"
35,5890,"beasts, a slave was given property rights in what was called his"
35,5891,"_peculium_, slaves were paid wages as an encouragement and"
35,5892,"stimulus, a form of slave marriage was recognized.  Very many"
35,5893,"forms of agriculture do not lend themselves to gang working, or"
35,5894,require gang workers only at certain seasons.  In regions where
35,5895,"such conditions prevailed the slave presently became a serf,"
35,5896,paying his owner part of his produce or working for him at certain
35,5897,seasons.
35,5909,When we begin to realize how essentially this great Latin and
35,5910,Greek-speaking Roman Empire of the first two centuries A.D. was a
35,5911,slave state and how small was the minority who had any pride or
35,5912,"freedom in their lives, we lay our hands on the clues to its decay"
35,5913,and collapse.  There was little of what we should call family
35,5914,"life, few homes of temperate living and active thought and study;"
35,5915,schools and colleges were few and far between.  The free will and
35,5916,"the free mind were nowhere to be found.  The great roads, the"
35,5917,"ruins of splendid buildings, the tradition of law and power it"
35,5918,left for the astonishment of succeeding generations must not
35,5919,conceal from us that all its outer splendour was built upon
35,5920,"thwarted wills, stifled intelligence, and crippled and perverted"
35,5921,desires.  And even the minority who lorded it over that wide realm
35,5922,of subjugation and of restraint and forced labour were uneasy and
35,5923,"unhappy in their souls; art and literature, science and"
35,5924,"philosophy, which are the fruits of free and happy minds, waned in"
35,5925,"that atmosphere.  There was much copying and imitation, an"
35,5926,"abundance of artistic artificers, much slavish pedantry among the"
35,5927,"servile men of learning, but the whole Roman empire in four"
35,5928,centuries produced nothing to set beside the bold and noble
35,5929,intellectual activities of the comparatively little city of Athens
35,5930,during its one century of greatness.  Athens decayed under the
35,5931,Roman sceptre.  The science of Alexandria decayed.  The spirit of
35,5932,"man, it seemed, was decaying in those days."
36,5944,The soul of man under that Latin and Greek empire of the first two
36,5945,centuries of the Christian era was a worried and frustrated soul.
36,5946,Compulsion and cruelty reigned; there were pride and display but
36,5947,little honour; little serenity or steadfast happiness.  The
36,5948,unfortunate were despised and wretched; the fortunate were
36,5949,insecure and feverishly eager for gratifications.  In a great
36,5950,"number of cities life centred on the red excitement of the arena,"
36,5951,where men and beasts fought and were tormented and slain.
36,5952,Amphitheatres are the most characteristic of Roman ruins.  Life
36,5953,went on in that key.  The uneasiness of men's hearts manifested
36,5954,itself in profound religious unrest.
36,5956,From the days when the Aryan hordes first broke in upon the
36,5957,"ancient civilizations, it was inevitable that the old gods of the"
36,5958,temples and priesthoods should suffer great adaptations or
36,5959,disappear.  In the course of hundreds of generations the
36,5960,agricultural peoples of the brunette civilizations had shaped
36,5961,their lives and thoughts to the temple-centred life.  Observances
36,5962,"and the fear of disturbed routines, sacrifices and mysteries,"
36,5963,dominated their minds.  Their gods seem monstrous and illogical to
36,5964,"our modern minds because we belong to an Aryanized world, but to"
36,5965,these older peoples these deities had the immediate conviction and
36,5966,vividness of things seen in an intense dream.  The conquest of one
36,5967,city state by another in Sumeria or early Egypt meant a change or
36,5968,"a renaming of gods or goddesses, but left the shape and spirit of"
36,5969,the worship intact.  There was no change in its general character.
36,5970,"The figures in the dream changed, but the dream went on and it was"
36,5971,the same sort of dream.  And the early Semitic conquerors were
36,5972,sufficiently akin in spirit to the Sumerians to take over the
36,5973,religion of the Mesopotamian civilization they subjugated without
36,5974,any profound alteration.  Egypt was never {209} indeed subjugated
36,5975,to the extent of a religious revolution.  Under the Ptolemies and
36,5976,"under the Caesars, her temples and altars and priesthoods remained"
36,5977,essentially Egyptian.
36,5979,So long as conquests went on between people of similar social and
36,5980,religious habits it was possible to get over the clash between the
36,5981,god of this temple and region and the god of that by a process of
36,5982,grouping or assimilation.  If the two gods were alike in character
36,5983,they were identified.  It was really the same god under another
36,5984,"name, said the priests and the people.  This fusion of gods is"
36,5985,called theocrasia; and the age of the great conquests of the
36,5986,thousand years B.C. was an age of theocrasia.  Over wide areas the
36,5987,"local gods were displaced by, or rather they were swallowed up in,"
36,5988,a general god.  So that when at last Hebrew prophets in Babylon
36,5989,proclaimed one God of Righteousness in all the earth men's minds
36,5990,were fully prepared for that idea.
36,5992,"But often the gods were too dissimilar for such an assimilation,"
36,5993,and then they were grouped together in some plausible
36,5994,relationship.  A female god--and the AEgean world before the coming
36,5995,of the Greek was much addicted to Mother Gods--would be married to
36,5996,"a male god, and an animal god or a star god would be humanized and"
36,5997,"the animal or astronomical aspect, the serpent or the sun or the"
36,5998,"star, made into an ornament or a symbol.  Or the god of a defeated"
36,5999,people would become a malignant antagonist to the brighter gods.
36,6000,"The history of theology is full of such adaptations, compromises"
36,6001,and rationalizations of once local gods.
36,6003,As Egypt developed from city states into one united kingdom there
36,6004,was much of this theocrasia.  The chief god so to speak was
36,6005,"Osiris, a sacrificial harvest god of whom Pharaoh was supposed to"
36,6006,be the earthly incarnation.  Osiris was represented as repeatedly
36,6007,dying and rising again; he was not only the seed and the harvest
36,6008,but also by a natural extension of thought the means of human
36,6009,immortality.  Among his symbols was the wide-winged scarabeus
36,6010,"beetle which buries its eggs to rise again, and also the effulgent"
36,6011,sun which sets to rise.  Later on he was to be identified with
36,6012,"Apis, the sacred bull.  Associated with him was the goddess Isis."
36,6013,"Isis was also Hathor, a cow-goddess, and the crescent moon and the"
36,6014,"Star of the sea.  Osiris dies and she bears a child, Horus, who is"
36,6015,"also a {210} hawk-god and the dawn, and who grows to become Osiris"
36,6016,again.  The effigies of Isis represent her as bearing the infant
36,6017,Horus in her arms and standing on the crescent moon.  These are
36,6018,"not logical relationships, but they were devised by the human mind"
36,6019,before the development of hard and systematic thinking and they
36,6020,have a dream-like coherence.  Beneath this triple group there are
36,6021,"other and darker Egyptian gods, bad gods, the dog-headed Anubis,"
36,6022,"black night and the like, devourers, tempters, enemies of god and"
36,6023,man.
36,6027,Every religious system does in the course of time fit itself to
36,6028,"the shape of the human soul, and there can be no doubt that out of"
36,6029,"these illogical and even uncouth symbols, Egyptian people were"
36,6030,able to fashion for themselves ways of genuine devotion and
36,6031,consolation.  The desire for immortality was very strong in the
36,6032,"Egyptian mind, and the religious life of Egypt turned on that"
36,6033,desire. The Egyptian {211} religion was an immortality religion as
36,6034,no other religion had ever been.  As Egypt went down under foreign
36,6035,conquerors and the Egyptian gods ceased to have any satisfactory
36,6036,"political significance, this craving for a life of compensations"
36,6037,"here-after, intensified."
36,6041,"After the Greek conquest, the new city of Alexandria became the"
36,6042,"centre of Egyptian religious life, and indeed of the religious"
36,6043,"life of the whole Hellenic world.  A great temple, the Serapeum,"
36,6044,was set up by Ptolemy I at which a sort of trinity of gods was
36,6045,"worshipped. These were Serapis (who was Osiris-Apis rechristened),"
36,6046,Isis and Horus. These were not regarded as separate gods but as
36,6047,"three aspects of one god, and Serapis was identified with the"
36,6048,"Greek Zeus, the Roman Jupiter and the Persian sun-god.  This"
36,6049,"worship spread wherever the Hellenic influence extended, even into"
36,6050,"North India and Western China.  The idea of immortality, an"
36,6051,"immortality of compensations and consolation, was eagerly received"
36,6052,by a world in which the common life was hopelessly wretched.
36,6053,"Serapis was called ""the saviour of souls.""  ""After death,"" said"
36,6054,"the hymns of that time, ""we are still in the care of his"
36,6055,"providence.""  Isis attracted many devotees.  Her images stood in"
36,6056,"her temples, as Queen of Heaven, bearing the infant Horus in her"
36,6057,"arms.  Candles were burnt before her, votive offerings were made"
36,6058,"to her, shaven priests consecrated to celibacy waited on her"
36,6059,altar.
36,6061,The rise of the Roman empire opened the western European world to
36,6062,"this growing cult.  The temples of Serapis-Isis, the chanting of"
36,6063,"the priests and the hope of immortal life, followed the Roman"
36,6064,standards to Scotland and Holland.  But there were many rivals to
36,6065,the Serapis-Isis religion.  Prominent among these was Mithraism.
36,6066,"This was a religion of Persian origin, and it {212} centred upon"
36,6067,some now forgotten mysteries about Mithras sacrificing a sacred
36,6068,and benevolent bull.  Here we seem to have something more
36,6069,primordial than the complicated and sophisticated Serapis-Isis
36,6070,beliefs.  We are carried back directly to the blood sacrifices of
36,6071,the heliolithic stage in human culture.  The bull upon the
36,6072,Mithraic monuments always bleeds copiously from a wound in its
36,6073,"side, and from this blood springs new life.  The votary to"
36,6074,Mithraism actually bathed in the blood of the sacrificial bull.
36,6075,At his initiation he went beneath a scaffolding upon which a bull
36,6076,was killed so that the blood could actually run down on him.
36,6078,"Both these religions, and the same is true of many other of the"
36,6079,numerous parallel cults that sought the allegiance of the slaves
36,6080,"and citizens under the earlier Roman emperors, are personal"
36,6081,religions.  They aim at personal salvation and personal
36,6082,immortality.  The older religions were not personal like that;
36,6083,they were social.  The older fashion of divinity was god or
36,6084,"goddess of the city first or of the state, and only secondarily of"
36,6085,the individual.  The sacrifices were a public and not a private
36,6086,function.  They concerned collective practical needs in this world
36,6087,in which we live.  But the Greeks first and now the Romans had
36,6088,pushed religion out of politics.  Guided by the Egyptian tradition
36,6089,religion had retreated to the other world.
36,6093,These new private immortality religions took all the heart and
36,6094,"emotion out of the old state religions, but they did not actually"
36,6095,replace them.  A typical city under the earlier Roman emperors
36,6096,would have a number of temples to all sorts of gods.  There might
36,6097,"be a temple to Jupiter of the Capitol, the great god of Rome, and"
36,6098,there would probably be one to the reigning Caesar.  For the Caesars
36,6099,had learnt from the Pharaohs the possibility of being gods.  In
36,6100,such temples a cold and stately political worship went on; one
36,6101,would go and make an offering and burn a pinch of incense to show
36,6102,"one's loyalty.  But it would be to the temple of Isis, the dear"
36,6103,"Queen of Heaven, one would go with the burthen {213} of one's"
36,6104,private troubles for advice and relief.  There might be local and
36,6105,"eccentric gods.  Seville, for example, long affected the worship"
36,6106,of the old Carthaginian Venus.  In a cave or an underground temple
36,6107,"there would certainly be an altar to Mithras, attended by"
36,6108,legionaries and slaves.  And probably also there would be a
36,6109,synagogue where the Jews gathered to read their Bible and uphold
36,6110,their faith in the unseen God of all the Earth.
36,6112,Sometimes there would be trouble with the Jews about the political
36,6113,side of the state religion.  They held that their God was a
36,6114,"jealous God intolerant of idolatry, and they would refuse to take"
36,6115,part in the public sacrifices to Caesar.  They would not even
36,6116,salute the Roman standards for fear of idolatry.
36,6118,In the East long before the time of Buddha there had been
36,6119,"ascetics, men and women who gave up most of the delights of life,"
36,6120,who repudiated marriage and property and sought spiritual powers
36,6121,and an escape from the stresses and mortifications of the world in
36,6122,"abstinence, pain and solitude.  Buddha himself set his face"
36,6123,"against ascetic extravagances, but many of his disciples followed"
36,6124,a monkish life of great severity.  Obscure Greek cults practised
36,6125,similar disciplines even to the extent of self-mutilation.
36,6126,Asceticism appeared in the Jewish communities of Judea and
36,6127,Alexandria also in the first century B.C.  Communities of men
36,6128,abandoned the world and gave themselves to austerities and
36,6129,mystical contemplation.  Such was the sect of the Essenes.
36,6130,Throughout the first and second centuries A.D. there was an almost
36,6131,"world-wide resort to such repudiations of life, a universal search"
36,6132,"for ""salvation"" from the distresses of the time.  The old sense of"
36,6133,"an established order, the old confidence in priest and temple and"
36,6134,"law and custom, had gone.  Amidst the prevailing slavery, cruelty,"
36,6135,"fear, anxiety, waste, display and hectic self-indulgence, went"
36,6136,"this epidemic of self-disgust and mental insecurity, this agonized"
36,6137,search for peace even at the price of renunciation and voluntary
36,6138,suffering.  This it was that filled the Serapeum with weeping
36,6139,penitents and brought the converts into the gloom and gore of the
36,6140,Mithraic cave.
37,6152,"It was while Augustus Caesar, the first of the Emperors, was"
37,6153,reigning in Rome that Jesus who is the Christ of Christianity was
37,6154,born in Judea.  In his name a religion was to arise which was
37,6155,destined to become the official religion of the entire Roman
37,6156,Empire.
37,6158,Now it is on the whole more convenient to keep history and
37,6159,theology apart.  A large proportion of the Christian world
37,6160,believes that Jesus was an incarnation of that God of all the
37,6161,"Earth whom the Jews first recognized.  The historian, if he is to"
37,6162,"remain historian, can neither accept nor deny that interpretation."
37,6163,"Materially Jesus appeared in the likeness of a man, and it is as a"
37,6164,man that the historian must deal with him.
37,6166,He appeared in Judea in the reign of Tiberius Caesar.  He was a
37,6167,prophet.  He preached after the fashion of the preceding Jewish
37,6168,"prophets.  He was a man of about thirty, and we are in the"
37,6169,profoundest ignorance of his manner of life before his preaching
37,6170,began.
37,6172,Our only direct sources of information about the life and teaching
37,6173,of Jesus are the four Gospels.  All four agree in giving us a
37,6174,"picture of a very definite personality.  One is obliged to say,"
37,6175,"""Here was a man.  This could not have been invented."""
37,6177,But just as the personality of Gautama Buddha has been distorted
37,6178,"and obscured by the stiff squatting figure, the gilded idol of"
37,6179,"later Buddhism, so one feels that the lean and strenuous"
37,6180,personality of Jesus is much wronged by the unreality and
37,6181,conventionality that a mistaken reverence has imposed upon his
37,6182,"figure in modern Christian art.  Jesus was a penniless teacher,"
37,6183,"who wandered about the dusty sun-bit country of Judea, living upon"
37,6184,"casual gifts of food; yet he is always represented clean, combed"
37,6185,"and sleek, in spotless raiment, erect and with something"
37,6186,motionless about him as though {215} he was gliding through the
37,6187,air.  This alone has made him unreal and incredible to many people
37,6188,who cannot distinguish the core of the story from the ornamental
37,6189,and unwise additions of the unintelligently devout.
37,6191,"We are left, if we do strip this record of these difficult"
37,6192,"accessories, with the figure of a being, very human, very earnest"
37,6193,"and passionate, capable of swift anger, and teaching a new and"
37,6194,"simple and profound doctrine--namely, the universal loving"
37,6195,Fatherhood of God and the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven.  He was
37,6196,clearly a person--to use a common phrase--of intense personal
37,6197,magnetism.  He attracted followers and filled them with love and
37,6198,courage.  Weak and ailing people were heartened and healed by his
37,6199,"presence.  Yet he was probably of a delicate physique, because of"
37,6200,the swiftness with which he died under the pains of crucifixion.
37,6201,"There is a tradition that he fainted when, according to the"
37,6202,"custom, he was made to bear his cross to the place of execution."
37,6203,He went about the country for three years spreading his doctrine
37,6204,and then he came to Jerusalem and was accused of trying to set up
37,6205,"a strange kingdom in Judea; he was tried upon this charge, and"
37,6206,crucified together with two thieves.  Long before these two were
37,6207,dead his sufferings were over.
37,6209,"The doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, which was the main teaching"
37,6210,"of Jesus, is certainly one of the most revolutionary doctrines"
37,6211,that ever stirred and changed human thought.  It is small wonder
37,6212,"if the world of that time failed to grasp its full significance,"
37,6213,and recoiled in dismay from even a half apprehension of its
37,6214,tremendous challenges to the established habits and institutions
37,6215,"of mankind.  For the doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, as Jesus"
37,6216,"seems to have preached it, was no less than a bold and"
37,6217,uncompromising demand for a complete change and cleansing of the
37,6218,"life of our struggling race, an utter cleansing, without and"
37,6219,within.  To the gospels the reader must go for all that is
37,6220,preserved of this tremendous teaching; here we are only concerned
37,6221,with the jar of its impact upon established ideas.
37,6223,"The Jews were persuaded that God, the one God of the whole world,"
37,6224,"was a righteous god, but they also thought of him as a trading god"
37,6225,"who had made a bargain with their Father Abraham {216} about them,"
37,6226,"a very good bargain indeed for them, to bring them at last to"
37,6227,predominance in the earth. With dismay and anger they heard Jesus
37,6228,"sweeping away their dear securities.  God, he taught, was no"
37,6229,bargainer; there were no chosen people and no favourites in the
37,6230,"Kingdom of Heaven.  God was the loving father of all life, as"
37,6231,incapable of showing favour as the universal sun.  And all men
37,6232,were brothers--sinners alike and beloved sons alike--of this
37,6233,divine father.  In the parable of the Good Samaritan Jesus cast
37,6234,"scorn upon that natural tendency we all obey, to glorify our own"
37,6235,people and to minimize the righteousness of other creeds and other
37,6236,races.  In the parable of the labourers he thrust aside the
37,6237,obstinate claim of the Jews to have a special claim upon God.  All
37,6238,"whom God takes into the kingdom, he taught, God serves alike;"
37,6239,"there is no distinction in his treatment, because there is no"
37,6240,"measure to his bounty.  From all moreover, as the parable of the"
37,6241,"buried talent witnesses, and as the incident of the widow's mite"
37,6242,"enforces, he demands the utmost.  There are no privileges, no"
37,6243,rebates and no excuses in the Kingdom of Heaven.
37,6250,But it is not only the intense tribal patriotism of the Jews that
37,6251,"Jesus outraged.  They were a people of intense family loyalty, and"
37,6252,he would have swept away all the narrow and restrictive family
37,6253,affections in the great flood of the love of God.  The whole
37,6254,kingdom of Heaven was to be the family of his followers.  We are
37,6255,"told that, ""While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother"
37,6256,"and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.  Then"
37,6257,"one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand"
37,6258,"without, desiring to speak with thee.  But he answered and said"
37,6259,"unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?"
37,6260,"And he stretched forth his hands towards his disciples, and said,"
37,6261,Behold my mother and my brethren!  For whosoever shall do the will
37,6262,"of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and"
37,6263,"sister, and mother.""  [2]"
37,6267,And not only did Jesus strike at patriotism and the bonds of
37,6268,family loyalty in the name of God's universal fatherhood and
37,6269,"brotherhood of all mankind, but it is clear that his teaching"
37,6270,"condemned all the gradations of the economic system, all private"
37,6271,"wealth, and {218} personal advantages.  All men belonged to the"
37,6272,kingdom; all their possessions belonged to the kingdom; the
37,6273,"righteous life for all men, the only righteous life, was the"
37,6274,"service of God's will with all that we had, with all that we were."
37,6275,Again and again he denounced private riches and the reservation of
37,6276,any private life.
37,6280,"""And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running,"
37,6281,"and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do"
37,6282,"that I may inherit eternal life?  And Jesus said to him, Why"
37,6283,"callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is God."
37,6284,"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not"
37,6285,"kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour"
37,6286,"thy father and mother.  And he answered and said unto him, Master,"
37,6287,all these things have I observed from my youth.  Then Jesus
37,6288,"beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou"
37,6289,"lackest; go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the"
37,6290,"poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up"
37,6291,"the cross, and follow me.  And he was sad at that saying, and went"
37,6292,away grieved; for he had great possessions.
37,6294,"""And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How"
37,6295,hardly shall they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God!
37,6296,And the disciples were astonished at his words.  But Jesus
37,6297,"answered again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for"
37,6298,them that trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!  It is
37,6299,"{220} easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than"
37,6300,"for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.""  [3]"
37,6310,"Moreover, in his tremendous prophecy of this kingdom which was to"
37,6311,"make all men one together in God, Jesus had small patience for the"
37,6312,bargaining righteousness of formal religion.  Another large part
37,6313,of his recorded utterances is aimed against the meticulous
37,6314,"observance of the rules of the pious career.  ""Then the Pharisees"
37,6315,"and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the"
37,6316,"tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?  He"
37,6317,"answered and said unto them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you"
37,6318,"hypocrites, as it is written,"
37,6320,"""This people honoureth me with their lips,"
37,6322,"""But their heart is far from me."
37,6324,"""Howbeit in vain do they worship me,"
37,6326,"""Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."
37,6328,"""For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of"
37,6329,"men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such things"
37,6330,"ye do.  And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment"
37,6331,"of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.""  [4]"
37,6333,It was not merely a moral and a social revolution that Jesus
37,6334,proclaimed; it is clear from a score of indications that his
37,6335,teaching had a political bent of the plainest sort.  It is true
37,6336,"that he said his kingdom was not of this world, that it was in the"
37,6337,hearts of men and not upon a throne; but it is equally clear that
37,6338,wherever and in what measure his kingdom was set up in the hearts
37,6339,"of men, the outer world would be in that measure revolutionized"
37,6340,and made new.
37,6342,Whatever else the deafness and blindness of his hearers may have
37,6343,"missed in his utterances, it is plain they did not miss his"
37,6344,resolve to revolutionize the world.  The whole tenor of the
37,6345,opposition to him and the circumstances of his trial and execution
37,6346,show clearly that to his contemporaries he seemed to propose
37,6347,"plainly, and did propose plainly, to change and fuse and enlarge"
37,6348,all human life.
37,6350,"In view of what he plainly said, is it any wonder that all who"
37,6351,"were rich and prosperous felt a horror of strange things, a"
37,6352,swimming of their world at his teaching?  He was dragging out all
37,6353,the little private reservations they had made from social service
37,6354,into the light {221} of a universal religious life.  He was like
37,6355,some terrible moral huntsman digging mankind out of the snug
37,6356,burrows in which they had lived hitherto.  In the white blaze of
37,6357,"this kingdom of his there was to be no property, no privilege, no"
37,6358,pride and precedence; no motive indeed and no reward but love.  Is
37,6359,it any wonder that men were dazzled and blinded and cried out
37,6360,against him?  Even his disciples cried out when he would not spare
37,6361,them the light.  Is it any wonder that the priests realized that
37,6362,between this man and themselves there was no choice but that he or
37,6363,priestcraft should perish?  Is it any wonder that the Roman
37,6364,"soldiers, confronted and amazed by something soaring over their"
37,6365,"comprehension and threatening all their disciplines, should take"
37,6366,"refuge in wild laughter, and crown him with thorns and robe him in"
37,6367,purple and make a mock Caesar of him?  For to take him seriously
37,6368,"was to enter upon a strange and alarming life, to abandon habits,"
37,6369,"to control instincts and impulses, to essay an incredible"
37,6370,happiness. . . .
38,6388,In the four gospels we find the personality and teachings of Jesus
38,6389,but very little of the dogmas of the Christian church.  It is in
38,6390,"the epistles, a series of writings by the immediate followers of"
38,6391,"Jesus, that the broad lines of Christian belief are laid down."
38,6393,Chief among the makers of Christian doctrine was St. Paul.  He had
38,6394,never seen Jesus nor heard him preach.  Paul's name was originally
38,6395,"Saul, and he was conspicuous at first as an active persecutor of"
38,6396,the little band of disciples after the crucifixion.  Then he was
38,6397,"suddenly converted to Christianity, and he changed his name to"
38,6398,Paul.  He was a man of great intellectual vigour and deeply and
38,6399,passionately interested in the religious movements of the time.
38,6400,He was well versed in Judaism and in the Mithraism and Alexandrian
38,6401,religion of the day.  He carried over many of their ideas and
38,6402,terms of expression into Christianity.  He did very little to
38,6403,"enlarge or develop the original teaching of Jesus, the teaching of"
38,6404,the Kingdom of Heaven.  But he taught that Jesus was not only the
38,6405,"promised Christ, the promised leader of the Jews, but also that"
38,6406,"his death was a sacrifice, like the deaths of the ancient"
38,6407,"sacrificial victims of the primordial civilizations, for the"
38,6408,redemption of mankind.
38,6410,When religions flourish side by side they tend to pick up each
38,6411,"other's ceremonial and other outward peculiarities.  Buddhism, for"
38,6412,"example, in China has now almost the same sort of temples and"
38,6413,"priests and uses as Taoism, which follows in the teachings of Lao"
38,6414,Tse.  Yet the original teachings of Buddhism and Taoism were
38,6415,almost flatly opposed.  And it reflects no doubt or discredit upon
38,6416,the essentials of Christian teaching that it took over not merely
38,6417,"such formal things as the shaven priest, the votive offering, the"
38,6418,"altars, candles, chanting and images of the Alexandrian and"
38,6419,"Mithraic faiths, but adopted even their devotional phrases and"
38,6420,their theological {223} ideas.  All these religions were
38,6421,flourishing side by side with many less prominent cults.  Each was
38,6422,"seeking adherents, and there must have been a constant going and"
38,6423,coming of converts between them.  Sometimes one or other would be
38,6424,in favour with the government.  But Christianity was regarded with
38,6425,"more suspicion than its rivals because, like the Jews, its"
38,6426,adherents would not perform acts of worship to the God Caesar.
38,6427,"This made it a seditious religion, quite apart from the"
38,6428,revolutionary spirit of the teachings of Jesus himself.
38,6433,"St. Paul familiarized his disciples with the idea that Jesus, like"
38,6434,"{224} Osiris, was a god who died to rise again and give men"
38,6435,immortality.  And presently the spreading Christian community was
38,6436,greatly torn by complicated theological disputes about the
38,6437,relationship of this God Jesus to God the Father of Mankind.  The
38,6438,"Arians taught that Jesus was divine, but distant from and inferior"
38,6439,to the Father.  The Sabellians taught that Jesus was merely an
38,6440,"aspect of the Father, and that God was Jesus and Father at the"
38,6441,same time just as a man may be a father and an artificer at the
38,6442,same time; and the Trinitarians taught a more subtle doctrine that
38,6443,"God was both one and three, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  For a"
38,6444,"time it seemed that Arianism would prevail over its rivals, and"
38,6445,"then after disputes, violence and wars, the Trinitarian formula"
38,6446,became the accepted formula of all Christendom.  It may be found
38,6447,in its completest expression in the Athanasian Creed.
38,6449,We offer no comment on these controversies here.  They do not sway
38,6450,history as the personal teaching of Jesus sways history.  The
38,6451,personal teaching of Jesus does seem to mark a new phase in the
38,6452,moral and spiritual life of our race.  Its insistence upon the
38,6453,universal Fatherhood of God and the implicit brotherhood of all
38,6454,"men, its insistence upon the sacredness of every human personality"
38,6455,"as a living temple of God, was to have the profoundest effect upon"
38,6456,all the subsequent social and political life of mankind.  With
38,6457,"Christianity, with the spreading teachings of Jesus, a new respect"
38,6458,"appears in the world for man as man.  It may be true, as hostile"
38,6459,"critics of Christianity have urged, that St.. Paul preached"
38,6460,"obedience to slaves, but it is equally true that the whole spirit"
38,6461,of the teachings of Jesus preserved in the gospels was against the
38,6462,subjugation of man by man.  And still more distinctly was
38,6463,Christianity opposed to such outrages upon human dignity as the
38,6464,gladiatorial combats in the arena.
38,6466,"Throughout the first two centuries after Christ, the Christian"
38,6467,"religion spread throughout the Roman Empire, weaving together an"
38,6468,ever-growing multitude of converts into a new community of ideas
38,6469,and will.  The attitude of the emperors varied between hostility
38,6470,and toleration.  There were attempts to suppress this new faith in
38,6471,both the second and third centuries; and finally in 303 and the
38,6472,following years a great persecution under the Emperor Diocletian.
38,6473,The considerable accumulations of Church property were {225}
38,6474,"seized, all bibles and religious writings were confiscated and"
38,6475,"destroyed, Christians were put out of the protection of the law"
38,6476,and many executed.  The destruction of the books is particularly
38,6477,notable.  It shows how the power of the written word in holding
38,6478,together {226} the new faith was appreciated by the authorities.
38,6479,"These ""book religions,"" Christianity and Judaism, were religions"
38,6480,that educated.  Their continued existence depended very largely on
38,6481,people being able to read and understand their doctrinal ideas.
38,6482,The older religions had made no such appeal to the personal
38,6483,intelligence.  In the ages of barbaric confusion that were now at
38,6484,hand in western Europe it was the Christian church that was mainly
38,6485,instrumental in preserving the tradition of learning.
38,6489,The persecution of Diocletian failed completely to suppress the
38,6490,growing Christian community.  In many provinces it was ineffective
38,6491,because the bulk of the population and many of the officials were
38,6492,Christian.  In 317 an edict of toleration was issued by the
38,6493,"associated Emperor Galerius, and in 324 Constantine the Great, a"
38,6494,"friend and on his deathbed a baptized convert to Christianity,"
38,6495,became sole ruler of the Roman world.  He abandoned all divine
38,6496,pretensions and put Christian symbols on the shields and banners
38,6497,of his troops.
38,6499,In a few years Christianity was securely established as the
38,6500,official religion of the empire.  The competing religions
38,6501,"disappeared or were absorbed with extraordinary celerity, and in"
38,6502,300 Theodosius the Great caused the great statue of Jupiter
38,6503,Serapis at Alexandria to be destroyed.  From the outset of the
38,6504,fifth century onward the only priests or temples in the Roman
38,6505,Empire were Christian priests and temples.
39,6517,"Throughout the third century the Roman Empire, decaying socially"
39,6518,"and disintegrating morally, faced the barbarians.  The emperors of"
39,6519,"this period were fighting military autocrats, and the capital of"
39,6520,the empire shifted with the necessities of their military policy.
39,6521,"Now the imperial headquarters would be at Milan in north Italy,"
39,6522,"now in what is now Serbia at Sirmium or Nish, now in Nicomedia in"
39,6523,Asia Minor.  Rome halfway down Italy was too far from the centre
39,6524,of interest to be a convenient imperial seat.  It was a declining
39,6525,city.  Over most of the empire peace still prevailed and men went
39,6526,about without arms.  The armies continued to be the sole
39,6527,"repositories of power; the emperors, dependent on their legions,"
39,6528,became more and more autocratic to the rest of the empire and
39,6529,their state more and more like that of the Persian and other
39,6530,oriental monarchs.  Diocletian assumed a royal diadem and oriental
39,6531,robes.
39,6533,"All along the imperial frontier, which ran roughly along the Rhine"
39,6534,"and Danube, enemies were now pressing.  The Franks and other"
39,6535,German tribes had come up to the Rhine.  In north Hungary were the
39,6536,"Vandals; in what was once Dacia and is now Roumania, the Visigoths"
39,6537,or West Goths.  Behind these in south Russia were the East Goths
39,6538,"or Ostrogoths, and beyond these again in the Volga region the"
39,6539,Alans.  But now Mongolian peoples were forcing their way towards
39,6540,Europe.  The Huns were already exacting tribute from the Alans and
39,6541,Ostrogoths and pushing them to the west.
39,6543,In Asia the Roman frontiers were crumpling back under the push of
39,6544,"a renascent Persia.  This new Persia, the Persia of the Sassenid"
39,6545,"kings, was to be a vigorous and on the whole a successful rival of"
39,6546,the Roman Empire in Asia for the next three centuries.
39,6548,A glance at the map of Europe will show the reader the peculiar
39,6549,weakness of the empire.  The river Danube comes down to within
39,6550,{228} a couple of hundred miles of the Adriatic Sea in the region
39,6551,of what is now Bosnia and Serbia.  It makes a square re-entrant
39,6552,angle there.  The Romans never kept their sea communications in
39,6553,"good order, and this two hundred mile strip of land was their line"
39,6554,of communication between the western Latin-speaking part of the
39,6555,empire and the eastern Greek-speaking portion.  Against this
39,6556,square angle of the Danube the barbarian pressure was greatest.
39,6557,When they broke through there it was inevitable that the empire
39,6558,should fall into two parts.
39,6562,A more vigorous empire might have thrust forward and reconquered
39,6563,"Dacia, but the Roman Empire lacked any such vigour.  Constantine"
39,6564,the Great was certainly a monarch of great devotion and
39,6565,intelligence.  He beat back a raid of the Goths from just these
39,6566,"vital Balkan regions, but he had no force to carry the frontier"
39,6567,across the Danube.  He was too pre-occupied with the internal
39,6568,weaknesses of the empire.  He brought the solidarity and moral
39,6569,force of Christianity to revive the spirit of the declining
39,6570,"empire, and he decided to create a new permanent capital at"
39,6571,"Byzantium upon the Hellespont.  This new-made Byzantium, which was"
39,6572,"re-christened Constantinople in his honour, was still building"
39,6573,when he died.  Towards the end of his reign occurred a remarkable
39,6574,"transaction.  The {229} Vandals, being pressed by the Goths, asked"
39,6575,to be received into the Roman Empire.  They were assigned lands in
39,6576,"Pannonia, which is now that part of Hungary west of the Danube,"
39,6577,and their fighting men became nominally legionaries.  But these
39,6578,new legionaries remained under their own chiefs.  Rome failed to
39,6579,digest them.
39,6583,"Constantine died working to reorganize his great realm, and soon"
39,6584,the frontiers were ruptured again and the Visigoths came almost to
39,6585,Constantinople. They defeated the Emperor Valens at Adrianople and
39,6586,"made a settlement in what is now Bulgaria, similar to the"
39,6587,settlement of the Vandals in Pannonia.  Nominally they were
39,6588,"subjects of the emperor, practically they were conquerors."
39,6590,"From 379 to 395 A.D. reigned the Emperor Theodosius the Great, and"
39,6591,while he reigned the empire was still formally intact.  Over the
39,6592,"armies of Italy and Pannonia presided Stilicho, a Vandal, over the"
39,6593,"armies in the Balkan peninsula, Alaric, a Goth.  When Theodosius"
39,6594,died at the close of the fourth century he left {230} two sons.
39,6595,"Alaric supported one of these, Arcadius, in Constantinople, and"
39,6596,"Stilicho the other, Honorius, in Italy.  In other words Alaric and"
39,6597,Stilicho fought for the empire with the princes as puppets.  In
39,6598,the course of their struggle Alaric marched into Italy and after a
39,6599,short siege took Rome (410 A.D.).
39,6601,The opening half of the fifth century saw the whole of the Roman
39,6602,Empire in Europe the prey of robber armies of barbarians.  It is
39,6603,difficult to visualize the state of affairs in the world at that
39,6604,"time.  Over France, Spain, Italy and the Balkan peninsula, the"
39,6605,great cities that had flourished under the early empire still
39,6606,"stood, impoverished, partly depopulated and falling into decay."
39,6607,"Life in them must have been shallow, mean and full of uncertainty."
39,6608,Local officials asserted their authority and went on with their
39,6609,"work with such conscience as they had, no doubt in the name of a"
39,6610,"now remote and inaccessible emperor.  The churches went on, but"
39,6611,usually with illiterate priests.  There was little reading and
39,6612,much superstition and fear.  But everywhere except where looters
39,6613,"had destroyed them, books and pictures and statuary and such-like"
39,6614,works of art were still to be found.
39,6616,The life of the countryside had also degenerated.  Everywhere this
39,6617,Roman world was much more weedy and untidy than it had been.  In
39,6618,some regions war and pestilence had brought the land down to the
39,6619,level of a waste.  Roads and forests were infested with robbers.
39,6620,"Into such regions the barbarians marched, with little or no"
39,6621,"opposition, and set up their chiefs as rulers, often with Roman"
39,6622,official titles.  If they were half civilized barbarians they
39,6623,"would give the conquered districts tolerable terms, they would"
39,6624,"take possession of the towns, associate and intermarry, and"
39,6625,"acquire (with an accent) the Latin speech; but the Jutes, the"
39,6626,Angles and Saxons who submerged the Roman province of Britain were
39,6627,"agriculturalists and had no use for towns, they seem to have swept"
39,6628,south Britain clear of the Romanized population and they replaced
39,6629,"the language by their own Teutonic dialects, which became at last"
39,6630,English.
39,6632,It is impossible in the space at our disposal to trace the
39,6633,movements of all the various German and Slavonic tribes as they
39,6634,went to and fro in the disorganized empire in search of plunder
39,6635,and a pleasant home.  But let the Vandals serve as an example.
39,6636,They came into {232} history in east Germany.  They settled as we
39,6637,have told in Pannonia.  Thence they moved somewhen about 425 A.D.
39,6638,through the intervening provinces to Spain.  There they found
39,6639,Visigoths from South Russia and other German tribes setting up
39,6640,dukes and kings.  From Spain the Vandals under Genseric sailed for
39,6641,"North Africa (429), captured Carthage (439), and built a fleet."
39,6642,They secured the mastery of the sea and captured and pillaged Rome
39,6643,"(455), which had recovered very imperfectly from her capture and"
39,6644,looting by Alaric half a century earlier.  Then the Vandals made
39,6645,"themselves masters of Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia and most of the"
39,6646,"other islands of the western Mediterranean.  They made, in fact, a"
39,6647,sea empire very similar in its extent to the sea empire of
39,6648,Carthage seven hundred odd years before.  They were at the climax
39,6649,of their power about 477.  They were a mere handful of conquerors
39,6650,holding all this country.  In the next century almost all their
39,6651,territory had been reconquered for the empire of Constantinople
39,6652,during a transitory blaze of energy under Justinian I.
39,6663,The story of the Vandals is but one sample of a host of similar
39,6664,adventures.  But now there was coming into the European world the
39,6665,"least kindred and most redoubtable of all these devastators, the"
39,6666,"Mongolian Huns or Tartars, a yellow people active and able, such"
39,6667,as the western world had never before encountered.
40,6679,This appearance of a conquering Mongolian people in Europe may be
40,6680,taken to mark a new stage in human history.  Until the last
40,6681,"century or so before the Christian era, the Mongol and the Nordic"
40,6682,peoples had not been in close touch.  Far away in the frozen lands
40,6683,"beyond the northern forests the Lapps, a Mongolian people, had"
40,6684,"drifted westward as far as Lapland, but they played no part in the"
40,6685,main current of history.  For thousands of years the western world
40,6686,"carried on the dramatic interplay of the Aryan, Semitic and"
40,6687,fundamental brunette peoples with very little interference (except
40,6688,for an Ethiopian invasion of Egypt or so) either from the black
40,6689,peoples to the south or from the Mongolian world in the far East.
40,6691,It is probable that there were two chief causes for the new
40,6692,westward drift of the nomadic Mongolians.  One was the
40,6693,"consolidation of the great empire of China, its extension"
40,6694,northward and the increase of its population during the prosperous
40,6695,period of the Han dynasty.  The other was some process of climatic
40,6696,change; a lesser rainfall that abolished swamps and forests
40,6697,"perhaps, or a greater rainfall that extended grazing over desert"
40,6698,"steppes, or even perhaps both these processes going on in"
40,6699,different regions but which anyhow facilitated a westward
40,6700,migration.  A third contributary cause was the economic
40,6701,"wretchedness, internal decay and falling population of the Roman"
40,6702,"Empire.  The rich men of the later Roman Republic, and then the"
40,6703,tax-gatherers of the military emperors had utterly consumed its
40,6704,"vitality.  So we have the factors of thrust, means and"
40,6705,"opportunity.  There was pressure from the east, rot in the west"
40,6706,and an open road.
40,6708,The Hun had reached the eastern boundaries of European Russia by
40,6709,"the first century A.D., but it was not until the fourth and {234}"
40,6710,fifth centuries A.D. that these horsemen rose to predominance upon
40,6711,the steppes.  The fifth century was the Hun's century.  The first
40,6712,Huns to come into Italy were mercenary bands in the pay of
40,6713,"Stilicho the Vandal, the master of Honorius.  Presently they were"
40,6714,"in possession of Pannonia, the empty nest of the Vandals."
40,6716,By the second quarter of the fifth century a great war chief had
40,6717,"arisen among the Huns, Attila.  We have only vague and tantalizing"
40,6718,glimpses of his power.  He ruled not only over the Huns but over a
40,6719,conglomerate of tributary Germanic tribes; his empire extended
40,6720,from the Rhine cross the plains into Central Asia.  He exchanged
40,6721,ambassadors with China.  His head camp was in the plain of Hungary
40,6722,east of the Danube.  There he was visited by an envoy from
40,6723,"Constantinople, Priscus, who has left us an account of his state."
40,6724,The way of living of these Mongols was very like the way of living
40,6725,of the primitive Aryans they had replaced.  The common folk were
40,6726,in huts and tents; the chiefs lived in great stockaded timber
40,6727,halls.  There were feasts and drinking and singing by the bards.
40,6728,The Homeric heroes and even the Macedonian companions of Alexander
40,6729,would probably have felt more at home in the camp-capital of
40,6730,Attila than they would have done in the cultivated and decadent
40,6731,"court of Theodosius II, the son of Arcadius, who was then reigning"
40,6732,in Constantinople.
40,6734,For a time it seemed as though the nomads under the leadership
40,6735,of the Huns and Attila would play the same part towards the
40,6736,Graeco-Roman civilization of the Mediterranean countries that the
40,6737,barbaric Greeks had played long ago to the AEgean civilization.  It
40,6738,looked like history repeating itself upon a larger stage.  But the
40,6739,Huns were much more wedded to the nomadic life than the early
40,6740,"Greeks, who were rather migratory cattle farmers than true nomads."
40,6741,The Huns raided and plundered but did not settle.
40,6743,For some years Attila bullied Theodosius as he chose.  His armies
40,6744,"devastated and looted right down to the walls of Constantinople,"
40,6745,Gibbon says that he totally destroyed no less than seventy cities
40,6746,"in the Balkan peninsula, and Theodosius bought him off by payments"
40,6747,of tribute and tried to get rid of him for good by sending secret
40,6748,agents to assassinate him.  In 451 Attila turned his attention to
40,6749,the remains of the Latin-speaking half of the empire and invaded
40,6750,{235} Gaul.  Nearly every town in northern Gaul was sacked.
40,6751,"Franks, Visigoths and the imperial forces united against him and"
40,6752,he was defeated at Troyes in a vast dispersed battle in which a
40,6753,"multitude of men, variously estimated as between 150,000 and"
40,6754,"300,000, were killed. This checked him in Gaul, but it did not"
40,6755,exhaust his enormous military resources.  Next year he came into
40,6756,"Italy by way of Venetia, burnt Aquileia and Padua and looted"
40,6757,Milan.
40,6761,Numbers of fugitives from these north Italian towns and
40,6762,particularly from Padua fled to islands in the lagoons at the head
40,6763,of the Adriatic and laid there the foundations of the city state
40,6764,"of Venice, which was to become one of the greatest or the trading"
40,6765,centres in the middle ages.
40,6767,In 453 Attila died suddenly after a great feast to celebrate his
40,6768,"marriage to a young woman, and at his death this plunder"
40,6769,confederation of his fell to pieces.  The actual Huns disappear
40,6770,"from history, mixed into the surrounding more numerous"
40,6771,Aryan-speaking populations.  {236} But these great Hun raids
40,6772,practically consummated the end of the Latin Roman Empire.  After
40,6773,"his death ten different emperors ruled in Rome in twenty years,"
40,6774,set up by Vandal and other mercenary troops.  The Vandals from
40,6775,"Carthage took and sacked Rome in 455.  Finally in 476 Odoacer, the"
40,6776,"chief of the barbarian troops, suppressed a Pannonian who was"
40,6777,figuring as emperor under the impressive name of Romulus
40,6778,"Augustulus, and informed the Court of Constantinople that there"
40,6779,was no longer an emperor in the west.  So ingloriously the Latin
40,6780,Roman Empire came to an end.  In 493 Theodoric the Goth became
40,6781,King of Rome.
40,6783,All over western and central Europe now barbarian chiefs were
40,6784,"reigning as kings, dukes and the like, practically independent but"
40,6785,for the most part professing some sort of shadowy allegiance to
40,6786,the emperor.  There were hundreds and perhaps thousands of such
40,6787,"practically independent brigand rulers.  In Gaul, Spain and Italy"
40,6788,and in Dacia the Latin speech still prevailed in locally distorted
40,6789,"forms, but in Britain and east of the Rhine languages of the"
40,6790,"German group (or in Bohemia a Slavonic language, Czech) were the"
40,6791,common speech.  The superior clergy and a small remnant of other
40,6792,educated men read and wrote Latin.  Everywhere life was insecure
40,6793,and property was held by the strong arm.  Castles multiplied and
40,6794,roads fell into decay.  The dawn of the sixth century was an age
40,6795,of division and of intellectual darkness throughout the western
40,6796,world.  Had it not been for the monks and Christian missionaries
40,6797,Latin learning might have perished altogether.
40,6799,Why had the Roman Empire grown and why had it so completely
40,6800,decayed?  It grew because at first the idea of citizenship held it
40,6801,"together.  Throughout the days of the expanding republic, and even"
40,6802,into the days of the early empire there remained a great number of
40,6803,"men conscious of Roman citizenship, feeling it a privilege and an"
40,6804,"obligation to be a Roman citizen, confident of their rights under"
40,6805,the Roman law and willing to make sacrifices in the name of Rome.
40,6806,The prestige of Rome as of something just and great and
40,6807,law-upholding spread far beyond the Roman boundaries.  But even as
40,6808,early as the Punic wars the sense of citizenship was being
40,6809,undermined by the growth of wealth and slavery.  Citizenship
40,6810,spread indeed but not the idea of citizenship.
40,6814,The Roman Empire was after all a very primitive organization; it
40,6815,"did not educate, did not explain itself to its increasing"
40,6816,"multitudes of citizens, did not invite their co-operation in its"
40,6817,decisions.  There was no network of schools to ensure a common
40,6818,"understanding, no distribution of news to sustain collective"
40,6819,activity.  The adventurers who struggled for power from the days
40,6820,of Marius and Sulla onward had no idea of creating and calling in
40,6821,public opinion upon the imperial affairs.  The spirit of
40,6822,citizenship died of starvation and no one observed it die.  All
40,6823,"empires, all states, all organizations of human society are, in"
40,6824,"the ultimate, things of understanding and will.  There remained no"
40,6825,will for the Roman Empire in the World and so it came to an end.
40,6827,But though the Latin-speaking Roman Empire died in the fifth
40,6828,"century, something else had been born within it that was to avail"
40,6829,"itself enormously of its prestige and tradition, and that was the"
40,6830,Latin-speaking half of the Catholic Church.  This lived while the
40,6831,"empire died because it appealed to the minds and wills of men,"
40,6832,because it had books and a great system of teachers and
40,6833,"missionaries to hold it together, things stronger than any law or"
40,6834,legions.  Throughout the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. while the
40,6835,"empire was decaying, Christianity was spreading to a universal"
40,6836,"dominion in Europe.  It conquered its conquerors, the barbarians."
40,6837,"When Attila seemed disposed to march on Rome, the patriarch of"
40,6838,"Rome intercepted him and did what no armies could do, turning him"
40,6839,back by sheer moral force.
40,6841,The Patriarch or Pope of Rome claimed to be the head of the entire
40,6842,"Christian church.  Now that there were no more emperors, he began"
40,6843,to annex imperial titles and claims.  He took the title of
40,6844,"_pontifex maximus_, head sacrificial priest of the Roman dominion,"
40,6845,the most ancient of all the titles that the emperors had enjoyed.
41,6857,The Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman Empire showed much
41,6858,more political tenacity than the western half.  It weathered the
41,6859,"disasters of the fifth century A.D., which saw a complete and"
41,6860,final breaking up of the original Latin Roman power.  Attila
41,6861,bullied the Emperor Theodosius II and sacked and raided almost to
41,6862,"the walls of Constantinople, but that city remained intact.  The"
41,6863,"Nubians came down the Nile and looted Upper Egypt, but Lower Egypt"
41,6864,and Alexandria were left still fairly prosperous.  Most of Asia
41,6865,Minor was held against the Sassanid Persians.
41,6867,"The sixth century, which was an age of complete darkness for the"
41,6868,"West, saw indeed a considerable revival of the Greek power."
41,6869,Justinian I (527-565) was a ruler of very great ambition and
41,6870,"energy, and he was married to the Empress Theodora, a woman of"
41,6871,quite equal capacity who had begun life as an actress.  Justinian
41,6872,reconquered North Africa from the Vandals and most of Italy from
41,6873,the Goths.  He even regained the south of Spain.  He did not limit
41,6874,his energies to naval and military enterprises.  He founded a
41,6875,"university, built the great church of Sta. Sophia in"
41,6876,Constantinople and codified the Roman law.  But in order to
41,6877,destroy a rival to his university foundation he closed the schools
41,6878,"of philosophy in Athens, which had been going on in unbroken"
41,6879,"continuity from the days of Plato, that is to say for nearly a"
41,6880,thousand years.
41,6882,From the third century onwards the Persian Empire had been the
41,6883,steadfast rival of the Byzantine.  The two empires kept Asia
41,6884,"Minor, Syria and Egypt in a state of perpetual unrest and waste."
41,6885,"In the first century A.D., these lands were still at a high level"
41,6886,"of civilization, wealthy and with an abundant population, but the"
41,6887,"continual coming and going of armies, massacres, looting and war"
41,6888,taxation wore them down steadily until only shattered and ruinous
41,6889,{239} cities remained upon a countryside of scattered peasants.
41,6890,In this melancholy process of impoverishment and disorder lower
41,6891,Egypt fared perhaps less badly than the rest of the world.
41,6892,"Alexandria, like Constantinople, continued a dwindling trade"
41,6893,between the east and the west.
41,6895,Science and political philosophy seemed dead now in both these
41,6896,"warring and decaying empires.  The last philosophers of Athens,"
41,6897,"until their suppression, preserved the texts of the great"
41,6898,literature of the past with an infinite reverence and want of
41,6899,"understanding.  But there remained no class of men in the world,"
41,6900,"no free gentlemen with bold and independent habits of thought, to"
41,6901,carry on the tradition of frank statement and enquiry embodied in
41,6902,these writings.  The social and political chaos accounts largely
41,6903,"for the disappearance of this class, but there was also another"
41,6904,reason why the human intelligence was sterile and feverish during
41,6905,this age.  In both Persia and Byzantium it was all age of
41,6906,"intolerance.  Both empires were religious empires in a new way, in"
41,6907,a way that greatly hampered the free activities of the human mind.
41,6916,"Of course the oldest empires in the world were religious empires,"
41,6917,centring upon the worship of a god or of a god-king.  Alexander
41,6918,was treated as a divinity and the Caesars were gods in so much as
41,6919,they had altars and temples devoted to them and the offering of
41,6920,incense was made a test of loyalty to the Roman state.  But these
41,6921,older religions were essentially religions of act and fact.  They
41,6922,did not invade the mind.  If a man offered his sacrifice and bowed
41,6923,"to the god, he was left not only to think but to say practically"
41,6924,whatever he liked about the affair.  But the new sort of religions
41,6925,"that had come into the world, and particularly Christianity,"
41,6926,turned inward.  These new faiths demanded not simply conformity
41,6927,but understanding belief.  Naturally fierce controversy ensued
41,6928,upon the exact meaning of the things believed.  These new
41,6929,religions were creed religions.  The world was confronted with a
41,6930,"new word, Orthodoxy, and with a stern resolve to keep not only"
41,6931,acts but speech {241} and private thought within the limits of a
41,6932,"set teaching.  For to hold a wrong opinion, much more to convey it"
41,6933,"to other people, was no longer regarded as an intellectual defect"
41,6934,but a moral fault that might condemn a soul to everlasting
41,6935,destruction.
41,6940,Both Ardashir I who founded the Sassanid dynasty in the third
41,6941,"century A.D., and Constantine the Great who reconstructed the"
41,6942,"Roman Empire in the fourth, turned to religious organizations for"
41,6943,"help, because in these organizations they saw a new means of using"
41,6944,and controlling the wills of men.  And already before the end of
41,6945,the fourth century both empires were persecuting free talk and
41,6946,religious innovation.  In Persia Ardashir found the ancient
41,6947,Persian religion of Zoroaster (or Zarathushtra) with its priests
41,6948,"and temples and a sacred fire that burnt upon its altars, ready"
41,6949,for his purpose as a state religion.  Before the end of the third
41,6950,"century Zoroastrianism was persecuting Christianity, and in 277"
41,6951,"A.D. Mani, the founder of {243} a new faith, the Manichaeans, was"
41,6952,"crucified and his body flayed.  Constantinople, on its side, was"
41,6953,busy hunting out Christian heresies.  Manichaean ideas infected
41,6954,Christianity and had to be fought with the fiercest methods; in
41,6955,return ideas from Christianity affected the purity of the
41,6956,"Zoroastrian doctrine.  All ideas became suspect.  Science, which"
41,6957,"demands before all things the free action of an untroubled mind,"
41,6958,suffered a complete eclipse throughout this phase of intolerance.
41,6968,"War, the bitterest theology, and the usual vices of mankind"
41,6969,"constituted Byzantine life of those days.  It was picturesque, it"
41,6970,was romantic; it had little sweetness or light.  When Byzantium
41,6971,"and Persia were not fighting the barbarians from the north, they"
41,6972,wasted Asia Minor and Syria in dreary and destructive hostilities.
41,6973,Even in close alliance these two empires would have found it a
41,6974,hard task to turn back the barbarians and recover their
41,6975,prosperity.  The Turks or Tartars first come into history as the
41,6976,allies first of one power and then of another.  In the sixth
41,6977,century the two chief antagonists were Justinian and Chosroes I;
41,6978,in the opening of the seventh the Emperor Heraclius was pitted
41,6979,against Chosroes II (580).
41,6981,At first and until after Heraclius had become Emperor (610)
41,6982,"Chosroes II carried all before him.  He took Antioch, Damascus and"
41,6983,"Jerusalem and his armies reached Chalcedon, which is in Asia Minor"
41,6984,over against Constantinople.  In 619 he conquered Egypt.  Then
41,6985,Heraclius pressed a counter attack home and routed a Persian army
41,6986,"at Nineveh (627), although at that time there were still Persian"
41,6987,troops at Chalcedon.  In 628 Chosroes II was deposed and murdered
41,6988,"by his son, Kavadh, and an inconclusive peace was made between the"
41,6989,two exhausted empires.
41,6991,Byzantium and Persia had fought their last war.  But few people as
41,6992,yet dreamt of the storm that was even then gathering in the
41,6993,"deserts to put an end for ever to this aimless, chronic struggle."
41,6995,While Heraclius was restoring order in Syria a message reached
41,6996,him.  It had been brought in to the imperial outpost at Bostra
41,6997,"south of Damascus; it was in Arabic, an obscure Semitic desert"
41,6998,"language, and it was read to the Emperor, if it reached him at"
41,6999,"all, by an interpreter.  It was from someone who called himself"
41,7000,"""Muhammad the Prophet of God.""  It called upon the Emperor to"
41,7001,{244} acknowledge the One True God and to serve him.  What the
41,7002,Emperor said is not recorded.
41,7004,"A similar message came to Kavadh at Ctesiphon.  He was annoyed,"
41,7005,"tore up the letter, and bade the messenger begone."
41,7007,"This Muhammad, it appeared, was a Bedouin leader whose"
41,7008,headquarters were in the mean little desert town of Medina.  He
41,7009,was preaching a new religion of faith in the One True God.
41,7011,"""Even so, O Lord!"" he said; ""rend thou his Kingdom from Kavadh."""
42,7023,"Throughout the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth centuries, there"
42,7024,was a steady drift of Mongolian peoples westward.  The Huns of
42,7025,"Attila were merely precursors of this advance, which led at last"
42,7026,"to the establishment of Mongolian peoples in Finland, Esthonia,"
42,7027,"Hungary and Bulgaria, where their descendants, speaking languages"
42,7028,"akin to Turkish, survive to this day.  The Mongolian nomads were,"
42,7029,"in fact, playing a role towards the Aryanized civilizations of"
42,7030,Europe and Persia and India that the Aryans had played to the
42,7031,AEgean and Semitic civilizations ten or fifteen centuries before.
42,7033,In Central Asia the Turkish peoples had taken root in what is now
42,7034,"Western Turkestan, and Persia already employed many Turkish"
42,7035,officials and Turkish mercenaries.  The Parthians had gone out of
42,7036,"history, absorbed into the general population of Persia.  There"
42,7037,were no more Aryan nomads in the history of Central Asia;
42,7038,Mongolian people had replaced them.  The Turks became masters of
42,7039,Asia from China to the Caspian.
42,7041,The same great pestilence at the end of the second century A.D.
42,7042,that had shattered the Roman Empire had overthrown the Han dynasty
42,7043,in China.  Then came a period of division and of Hunnish conquests
42,7044,"from which China arose refreshed, more rapidly and more completely"
42,7045,than Europe was destined to do.  Before the end of the sixth
42,7046,"century China was reunited under the Suy dynasty, and this by the"
42,7047,"time of Heraclius gave place to the Tang dynasty, whose reign"
42,7048,marks another great period of prosperity for China.
42,7050,"Throughout the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries China was the"
42,7051,most secure and civilized country in the world.  The Han dynasty
42,7052,had extended her boundaries in the north; the Suy and Tang
42,7053,"dynasties now spread her civilization to the south, and China"
42,7054,{247} began to assume the proportions she has to-day.  In Central
42,7055,"Asia indeed she reached much further, extending at last, through"
42,7056,"tributary Turkish tribes, to Persia and the Caspian Sea."
42,7067,The new China that had arisen was a very different land from the
42,7068,old China of the Hans.  A new and more vigorous literary school
42,7069,"appeared, there was a great poetic revival; Buddhism had"
42,7070,revolutionized philosophical and religious thought.  There were
42,7071,"great advances in artistic work, in technical skill and in all the"
42,7072,"amenities of life.  Tea was first used, paper manufactured and"
42,7073,wood-block printing began.  Millions of people indeed were leading
42,7074,"orderly, graceful and kindly lives in China during these centuries"
42,7075,when the attenuated populations of Europe and Western Asia were
42,7076,"living either in hovels, small walled cities or grim robber"
42,7077,fortresses.  While the mind of the west was black with theological
42,7078,"obsessions, the mind of China was open and tolerant and enquiring."
42,7080,"One of the earliest monarchs of the Tang dynasty was Tai-tsung,"
42,7081,"who began to reign in 627, the year of the victory of Heraclius at"
42,7082,"Nineveh.  He received an embassy from Heraclius, who was probably"
42,7083,seeking an ally in the rear of Persia.  From Persia itself came a
42,7084,party of Christian missionaries (635).  They were allowed to
42,7085,explain their creed to Tai-tsung and he examined a Chinese
42,7086,translation of their Scriptures.  He pronounced this strange
42,7087,"religion acceptable, and gave permission for the foundation of a"
42,7088,church and monastery.
42,7090,To this monarch also (in 628) came messengers from Muhammad.  They
42,7091,came to Canton on a trading ship.  They had sailed the whole way
42,7092,"from Arabia along the Indian coasts.  Unlike Heraclius and Kavadh,"
42,7093,Tai-Tsung gave these envoys a courteous hearing.  He expressed his
42,7094,interest in their theological ideas and assisted them to build a
42,7095,"mosque in Canton, a mosque which survives, it is said, to this"
42,7096,"day, the oldest mosque in the world."
43,7108,A prophetic amateur of history surveying the world in the opening
43,7109,of the seventh century might have concluded very reasonably that
43,7110,it was only a question of a few centuries before the whole of
43,7111,Europe and Asia fell under Mongolian domination.  There were no
43,7112,"signs of order or union in Western Europe, and the Byzantine and"
43,7113,Persian Empires were manifestly bent upon a mutual destruction.
43,7114,India also was divided and wasted.  On the other hand China was a
43,7115,steadily expanding empire which probably at that time exceeded all
43,7116,"Europe in population, and the Turkish people who were growing to"
43,7117,power in Central Asia were disposed to work in accord with China.
43,7118,And such a prophecy would not have been an altogether vain one.  A
43,7119,time was to come in the thirteenth century when a Mongolian
43,7120,"overlord would rule from the Danube to the Pacific, and Turkish"
43,7121,dynasties were destined to reign over the entire Byzantine and
43,7122,"Persian Empires, over Egypt and most of India."
43,7124,Where our prophet would have been most likely to have erred would
43,7125,have been in under-estimating the recuperative power of the Latin
43,7126,end of Europe and in ignoring the latent forces of the Arabian
43,7127,desert.  Arabia would have seemed what it had been for times
43,7128,"immemorial, the refuge of small and bickering nomadic tribes.  No"
43,7129,Semitic people had founded an empire now for more than a thousand
43,7130,years.
43,7132,Then suddenly the Bedouin flared out for a brief century of
43,7133,splendour.  They spread their rule and language from Spain to the
43,7134,boundaries of China.  They gave the world a new culture.  They
43,7135,created a religion that is still to this day one of the most vital
43,7136,forces in the world.
43,7140,The man who fired this Arab flame appears first in history as the
43,7141,young husband of the widow of a rich merchant of the town of
43,7142,"Mecca, named Muhammad.  Until he was forty he did very little to"
43,7143,distinguish himself in the world.  He seems to have taken
43,7144,considerable interest in religious discussion.  Mecca was a pagan
43,7145,"city at that time worshipping in particular a black stone, the"
43,7146,"Kaaba, of great repute throughout all Arabia and a centre of"
43,7147,pilgrimages; but there were great numbers of Jews in the
43,7148,country--indeed all the southern portion of Arabia professed the
43,7149,Jewish faith--and there were Christian churches in Syria.
43,7151,About forty Muhammad began to develop prophetic characteristics
43,7152,like those of the Hebrew prophets twelve hundred years before him.
43,7153,"He talked first to his wife of the One True God, and of the"
43,7154,rewards and punishments of virtue and wickedness.  There can be no
43,7155,doubt that his thoughts were very strongly influenced by Jewish
43,7156,and Christian ideas.  He gathered about him a small circle of
43,7157,believers and presently began to preach in the town against the
43,7158,prevalent idolatry.  This made him extremely unpopular with his
43,7159,fellow townsmen because the pilgrimages to the Kaaba were the
43,7160,chief source of such prosperity as Mecca enjoyed.  He became
43,7161,"bolder and more definite in his teaching, declaring himself to be"
43,7162,the last chosen prophet of God entrusted with a mission to perfect
43,7163,"religion.  Abraham, he declared, and Jesus Christ were his"
43,7164,forerunners.  He had been chosen to complete and perfect the
43,7165,revelation of God's will.
43,7167,He produced verses which he said had been communicated to him by
43,7168,"an angel, and he had a strange vision in which he was taken up"
43,7169,through the Heavens to God and instructed in his mission.
43,7171,As his teaching increased in force the hostility of his fellow
43,7172,townsmen increased also.  At last a plot was made to kill him; but
43,7173,"he escaped with his faithful friend and disciple, Abu Bekr, to the"
43,7174,friendly town of Medina which adopted his doctrine.  Hostilities
43,7175,followed between Mecca and Medina which ended at last in a treaty.
43,7176,Mecca was to adopt the worship of the One True God and accept
43,7177,"Muhammad as his prophet, but the adherents of the new _faith were"
43,7178,still to make the pilgrimage to Mecca_ just as they had done when
43,7179,they were pagans.  So Muhammad established the One True God in
43,7180,{251} Mecca without injuring its pilgrim traffic.  In 629 Muhammad
43,7181,"returned to Mecca as its master, a year after he had sent out"
43,7182,"these envoys of his to Heraclius, Tai-tsung, Kavadh and all the"
43,7183,rulers of the earth.
43,7195,"Then for four years more until his death in 632, Muhammad spread"
43,7196,his power over the rest of Arabia.  He married a number of wives
43,7197,"in his declining years, and his life on the whole was by modern"
43,7198,standards unedifying.  He seems to have been a man compounded of
43,7199,"very considerable vanity, greed, cunning, self-deception and quite"
43,7200,sincere religious passion.  He dictated a book of injunctions and
43,7201,"expositions, the Koran, which he declared was communicated to him"
43,7202,from God.  Regarded as literature or philosophy the Koran is
43,7203,certainly unworthy of its alleged Divine authorship.
43,7205,Yet when the manifest defects of Muhammad's life and writings have
43,7206,"been allowed for, there remains in Islam, this faith he imposed"
43,7207,"upon the Arabs, much power and inspiration.  One is its"
43,7208,uncompromising monotheism; its simple enthusiastic faith in the
43,7209,rule and fatherhood of God and its freedom from theological
43,7210,complications.  Another is its complete detachment from the
43,7211,sacrificial priest and the temple.  It is an entirely prophetic
43,7212,"religion, proof against any possibility of relapse towards blood"
43,7213,sacrifices.  In the Koran the limited {252} and ceremonial nature
43,7214,of the pilgrimage to Mecca is stated beyond the possibility of
43,7215,"dispute, and every precaution was taken by Muhammad to prevent the"
43,7216,deification of himself after his death.  And a third element of
43,7217,strength lay in the insistence of Islam upon the perfect
43,7218,"brotherhood and equality before God of all believers, whatever"
43,7219,"their colour, origin or status."
43,7221,These are the things that made Islam a power in human affairs.  It
43,7222,has been said that the true founder of the Empire of Islam was not
43,7223,"so much Muhammad as his friend and helper, Abu Bekr.  If Muhammad,"
43,7224,"with his shifty character, was the mind and imagination of"
43,7225,"primitive Islam, Abu Bekr was its conscience and its will."
43,7226,Whenever Muhammad wavered Abu Bekr sustained him.  And when
43,7227,"Muhammad died, Abu Bekr became Caliph (= successor), and with that"
43,7228,"faith that moves mountains, he set himself simply and sanely to"
43,7229,organize the subjugation of the whole world to Allah--with little
43,7230,"armies of 3,000 or 4,000 Arabs--according to those letters the"
43,7231,prophet had written from Medina in 628 to all the monarchs of the
43,7232,world.
44,7244,There follows the most amazing story of conquest in the whole
44,7245,history of our race.  The Byzantine army was smashed at the battle
44,7246,of the Yarmuk (a tributary of the Jordan) in 634; and the Emperor
44,7247,"Heraclius, his energy sapped by dropsy and his resources exhausted"
44,7248,"by the Persian war, saw his new conquests in Syria, Damascus,"
44,7249,"Palmyra, Antioch, Jerusalem and the rest fall almost without"
44,7250,resistance to the Moslim.  Large elements in the population went
44,7251,over to Islam.  Then the Moslim turned east.  The Persians had
44,7252,found an able general in Rustam; they had a great host with a
44,7253,force of elephants; and for three days they fought the Arabs at
44,7254,Kadessia (637) and broke at last in headlong rout.
44,7256,"The conquest of all Persia followed, and the Moslem Empire pushed"
44,7257,far into Western Turkestan and eastward until it met the Chinese.
44,7258,"Egypt fell almost without resistance to the new conquerors, who"
44,7259,"full of a fanatical belief in the sufficiency of the Koran, wiped"
44,7260,out the vestiges of the book-copying industry of the Alexandria
44,7261,Library.  The tide of conquest poured along the north coast of
44,7262,Africa to the Straits of Gibraltar and Spain.  Spain was invaded
44,7263,in 710 and the Pyrenees Mountains were reached in 720.  In 732 the
44,7264,"Arab advance had reached the centre of France, but here it was"
44,7265,stopped for good at the battle of Poitiers and thrust back as far
44,7266,as the Pyrenees again.  The conquest of Egypt had given the Moslim
44,7267,"a fleet, and for a time it looked as though they would take"
44,7268,Constantinople.  They made repeated sea attacks between 672 and
44,7269,718 but the great city held out against them.
44,7271,The Arabs had little political aptitude and no political
44,7272,"experience, and this great empire with its capital now at"
44,7273,"Damascus, which stretched from Spain to China, was destined to"
44,7274,break up very speedily. From the very beginning doctrinal
44,7275,differences undermined {254} its unity.  But our interest here
44,7276,lies not with the story of its political disintegration but with
44,7277,its effect upon the human mind and upon the general destinies of
44,7278,our race.  The Arab intelligence had been flung across the world
44,7279,even more swiftly and dramatically than had the Greek a thousand
44,7280,years before.  The intellectual stimulation of the whole world
44,7281,"west of China, the break-up of old ideas and development of new"
44,7282,"ones, was enormous."
44,7290,In Persia this fresh excited Arabic mind came into contact not
44,7291,"only with Manichaean, Zoroastrian and Christian doctrine, but with"
44,7292,"the scientific Greek literature, preserved not only in Greek but"
44,7293,in Syrian translations.  It found Greek learning in Egypt also.
44,7294,"Every-where, and particularly in Spain, it discovered an active"
44,7295,Jewish tradition of speculation and discussion.  In Central Asia
44,7296,it met Buddhism and the material achievements of Chinese
44,7297,civilization.  It learnt the manufacture of paper--which made
44,7298,printed books possible--from the Chinese.  And finally it came
44,7299,into touch with Indian mathematics and philosophy.
44,7303,Very speedily the intolerant self-sufficiency of the early days of
44,7304,"faith, which made the Koran seem the only possible book, was"
44,7305,dropped. Learning sprang up everywhere in the footsteps of the
44,7306,Arab conquerors.  By the eighth century there was an educational
44,7307,"{256} organization throughout the whole ""Arabized"" world.  In the"
44,7308,ninth learned men in the schools of Cordoba in Spain were
44,7309,"corresponding with learned men in Cairo, Bagdad, Bokhara and"
44,7310,Samarkand.  The Jewish mind assimilated very readily with the
44,7311,"Arab, and for a time the two Semitic races worked together through"
44,7312,the medium of Arabic.  Long after the political break-up and
44,7313,"enfeeblement of the Arabs, this intellectual community of the"
44,7314,Arab-speaking world endured.  It was still producing very
44,7315,considerable results in the thirteenth century.
44,7319,So it was that the systematic accumulation and criticism of facts
44,7320,which was first begun by the Greeks was resumed in this
44,7321,astonishing renascence of the Semitic world.  The seed of
44,7322,Aristotle and the museum of Alexandria that had lain so long
44,7323,inactive and neglected now germinated and began to grow towards
44,7324,"fruition.  Very great advances were made in mathematical, medical"
44,7325,and physical science.  {257} The clumsy Roman numerals were ousted
44,7326,by the Arabic figures we use to this day and the zero sign was
44,7327,first employed.  The very name _algebra_ is Arabic.  So is the
44,7328,"word chemistry.  The names of such stars as Algol, Aldebaran and"
44,7329,Bootes preserve the traces of Arab conquests in the sky.  Their
44,7330,philosophy was destined to reanimate the medieval philosophy of
44,7331,France and Italy and the whole Christian world.
44,7333,"The Arab experimental chemists were called alchemists, and they"
44,7334,were still sufficiently barbaric in spirit to keep their methods
44,7335,and results secret as far as possible.  They realized from the
44,7336,very beginning what enormous advantages their possible discoveries
44,7337,"might give them, and what far-reaching consequences they might"
44,7338,have on human life.  They came upon many metallurgical and
44,7339,"technical devices of the utmost value, alloys and dyes,"
44,7340,"distilling, tinctures and essences, optical glass; but the two"
44,7341,"chief ends they sought, they sought in vain.  One was ""the"
44,7342,"philosopher's stone""--a means of changing the metallic elements"
44,7343,"one into another and so getting a control of artificial gold, and"
44,7344,"the other was the _elixir vitoe_, a stimulant that would revivify"
44,7345,age and prolong life indefinitely.  The crabbed patient
44,7346,experimenting of these Arab alchemists spread into the Christian
44,7347,world.  The fascination of their enquiries spread.  Very gradually
44,7348,the activities of these alchemists became more social and
44,7349,co-operative.  They found it profitable to exchange and compare
44,7350,ideas.  By insensible gradations the last of the alchemists became
44,7351,the first of the experimental philosophers.
44,7353,The old alchemists sought the philosopher's stone which was to
44,7354,"transmute base metals to gold, and an elixir of immortality; they"
44,7355,found the methods of modern experimental science which promise in
44,7356,the end to give man illimitable power over the world and over his
44,7357,own destiny.
45,7369,It is worth while to note the extremely shrunken dimensions of the
45,7370,share of the world remaining under Aryan control in the seventh
45,7371,"and eighth centuries.  A thousand years before, the Aryan-speaking"
45,7372,races were triumphant over all the civilized world west of China.
45,7373,"Now the Mongol had thrust as far as Hungary, nothing of Asia"
45,7374,remained under Aryan rule except the Byzantine dominions in Asia
45,7375,"Minor, and all Africa was lost and nearly all Spain.  The great"
45,7376,Hellenic world had shrunken to a few possessions round the nucleus
45,7377,"of the trading city of Constantinople, and the memory of the Roman"
45,7378,world was kept alive by the Latin of the western Christian
45,7379,"priests.  In vivid contrast to this tale of retrogression, the"
45,7380,Semitic tradition had risen again from subjugation and obscurity
45,7381,after a thousand years of darkness.
45,7383,Yet the vitality of the Nordic peoples was not exhausted.
45,7384,Confined now to Central and North-Western Europe and terribly
45,7385,"muddled in their social and political ideas, they were"
45,7386,nevertheless building up gradually and steadily a new social order
45,7387,and preparing unconsciously for the recovery of a power even more
45,7388,extensive than that they had previously enjoyed.
45,7390,We have told how at the beginning of the sixth century there
45,7391,remained no central government in Western Europe at all.  That
45,7392,world was divided up among numbers of local rulers holding their
45,7393,own as they could.  This was too insecure a state of affairs to
45,7394,last; a system of co-operation and association grew up in this
45,7395,"disorder, the feudal system, which has left its traces upon"
45,7396,European life up to the present time.  This feudal system was a
45,7397,sort of crystallization of society about power.  Everywhere the
45,7398,lone man felt insecure and was prepared to barter a certain amount
45,7399,of his liberty for help and protection.  He sought a stronger man
45,7400,as his lord and protector; {259} he gave him military services and
45,7401,"paid him dues, and in return he was confirmed in his possession of"
45,7402,what was his.  His lord again found safety in vassalage to a still
45,7403,greater lord.  Cities also found it convenient to have feudal
45,7404,"protectors, and monasteries and church estates bound themselves by"
45,7405,similar ties.  No doubt in many cases allegiance was claimed
45,7406,before it was offered; the system grew downward as well as upward.
45,7407,"So a sort of pyramidal system grew up, varying widely in different"
45,7408,"localities, permitting at first a considerable play of violence"
45,7409,and private warfare but making steadily for order and a new reign
45,7410,of law.  The pyramids grew up until some became recognizable as
45,7411,kingdoms.  Already by the early sixth century a Frankish kingdom
45,7412,existed under its founder Clovis in what is now France and the
45,7413,"Netherlands, and presently Visigothic and Lombard and Gothic"
45,7414,kingdoms were in existence.
45,7416,The Moslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this
45,7417,"Frankish kingdom under the practical rule of Charles Martel, the"
45,7418,"Mayor of the Palace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and"
45,7419,experienced the decisive defeat of Poitiers (732) at his hands.
45,7420,This Charles Martel was practically overlord of Europe north of
45,7421,the Alps from the Pyrenees to Hungary.  He ruled over a multitude
45,7422,"of subordinate lords speaking French-Latin, and High and Low"
45,7423,German languages.  His son Pepin extinguished the last descendants
45,7424,of Clovis and took the kingly state and title.  His grandson
45,7425,"Charlemagne, who began to reign in 768, found himself lord of a"
45,7426,realm so large that he could think of reviving the title of Latin
45,7427,Emperor.  He conquered North Italy and made himself master of
45,7428,Rome.
45,7430,Approaching the story of Europe as we do from the wider horizons
45,7431,of a world history we can see much more distinctly than the mere
45,7432,nationalist historian how cramping and disastrous this tradition
45,7433,of the Latin Roman Empire was.  A narrow intense struggle for this
45,7434,phantom predominance was to consume European energy for more than
45,7435,a thousand years.  Through all that period it is possible to trace
45,7436,certain unquenchable antagonisms; they run through the wits of
45,7437,Europe like the obsessions of a demented mind.  One driving force
45,7438,"was this ambition of successful rulers, which Charlemagne (Charles"
45,7439,"the Great) embodied, to become Caesar.  The realm of Charlemagne"
45,7440,consisted of a complex of feudal German states at {260} various
45,7441,"stages of barbarism.  West of the Rhine, most of these German"
45,7442,peoples had learnt to speak various Latinized dialects which fused
45,7443,"at last to form French.  East of the Rhine, the racially similar"
45,7444,German peoples did not lose their German speech.  On account of
45,7445,"this, communication was difficult between these two groups of"
45,7446,barbarian conquerors and a split easily brought about.  The split
45,7447,was made the more easy by the fact that the Frankish usage made it
45,7448,seem natural to divide the empire of Charlemagne among his sons at
45,7449,his death.  So one aspect of the history of Europe from the days
45,7450,of Charlemagne onwards is a history of first this monarch and his
45,7451,"family and then that, struggling to a precarious headship of the"
45,7452,"kings, princes, dukes, bishops and cities of Europe, while a"
45,7453,steadily deepening antagonism between the French and German
45,7454,speaking elements develops in the medley.  There was a formality
45,7455,of election for each emperor; and the climax of his ambition was
45,7456,"to struggle to the possession of that worn-out, misplaced capital"
45,7457,Rome and to a coronation there.
45,7464,The next factor in the European political disorder was the resolve
45,7465,of the Church at Rome to make no temporal prince but the Pope of
45,7466,Rome himself emperor in effect.  He was already pontifex maximus;
45,7467,for all practical purposes he held the decaying city; if he had no
45,7468,armies he had at least a vast propaganda organization in his
45,7469,priests throughout the whole Latin world; if he had little power
45,7470,over men's bodies he held the keys of heaven and hell in their
45,7471,imaginations and could exercise much influence upon their souls.
45,7472,So throughout the middle ages while one prince manoeuvred against
45,7473,"another first for equality, then for ascendancy, and at last for"
45,7474,"the supreme prize, the Pope of Rome, sometimes boldly, sometimes"
45,7475,"craftily, sometimes feebly--for the Popes were a succession of"
45,7476,oldish men and the average reign of a Pope was not more than two
45,7477,years--manoeuvred for the submission of all the princes to himself
45,7478,as the ultimate overlord of Christendom.
45,7480,But these antagonisms of prince against prince and of Emperor
45,7481,against Pope do not by any means exhaust the factors of the
45,7482,European confusion.  There was still an Emperor in Constantinople
45,7483,speaking Greek and claiming the allegiance of all Europe.  When
45,7484,"Charlemagne sought to revive the empire, it was merely the Latin"
45,7485,end of the empire he revived.  It was natural that a sense of
45,7486,rivalry between Latin Empire and Greek Empire should develop very
45,7487,readily.  And still more readily did the rivalry of
45,7488,Greek-speaking Christianity and the newer Latin-speaking version
45,7489,develop.  The Pope of Rome claimed to be the successor of St.
45,7490,"Peter, the chief of the apostles of Christ, and the head of the"
45,7491,Christian community everywhere.  Neither the emperor nor the
45,7492,patriarch in Constantinople were disposed to acknowledge this
45,7493,claim.  A dispute about a fine point in the doctrine of the Holy
45,7494,Trinity consummated a long series of dissensions in a final
45,7495,rupture in 1054.  The Latin Church and the Greek Church became and
45,7496,remained thereafter distinct and frankly antagonistic.  This
45,7497,antagonism must be added to the others in our estimate of the
45,7498,conflicts that wasted Latin Christendom in the middle ages.
45,7500,Upon this divided world of Christendom rained the blows of three
45,7501,sets of antagonists.  About the Baltic and North Seas remained a
45,7502,series of Nordic tribes who were only very slowly and reluctantly
45,7503,{263} Christianized; these were the Northmen.  They had taken to
45,7504,"the sea and piracy, and were raiding all the Christian coasts down"
45,7505,to Spain.  They had pushed up the Russian rivers to the desolate
45,7506,central lands and brought their shipping over into the
45,7507,south-flowing rivers.  They had come out upon the Caspian and Black
45,7508,Seas as pirates also.  They set up principalities in Russia; they
45,7509,were the first people to be called Russians.  These Northmen
45,7510,Russians came near to taking Constantinople.  England in the early
45,7511,"ninth century was a Christianized Low German country under a king,"
45,7512,"Egbert, a protege and pupil of Charlemagne.  The Northmen wrested"
45,7513,"half the kingdom from his successor Alfred the Great (886), and"
45,7514,finally under Canute (1016) made themselves masters of the whole
45,7515,land.  Under Rolph the Ganger (912) another band of Northmen
45,7516,"conquered the north of France, which became Normandy."
45,7527,"Canute ruled not only over England but over Norway and Denmark,"
45,7528,but his brief empire fell to pieces at his death through that
45,7529,political weakness of the barbaric peoples--division among a
45,7530,ruler's sons.  It is interesting to speculate what might have
45,7531,happened if this temporary union of the Northmen had endured.
45,7532,They were a race of astonishing boldness and energy.  They sailed
45,7533,in their galleys even to Iceland and Greenland.  They were the
45,7534,first Europeans to land on American soil.  Later on Norman
45,7535,adventurers were to recover Sicily from the Saracens and sack
45,7536,Rome.  It is a fascinating thing to imagine what a great northern
45,7537,"sea-faring power might have grown out of Canute's kingdom,"
45,7538,reaching from America to Russia.
45,7540,To the east of the Germans and Latinized Europeans was a medley of
45,7541,Slav tribes and Turkish peoples.  Prominent among these were the
45,7542,Magyars or Hungarians who were coming westward throughout the
45,7543,"eighth and ninth centuries.  Charlemagne held them for a time, but"
45,7544,after his death they established themselves in what is now
45,7545,"Hungary; and after the fashion of their kindred predecessors, the"
45,7546,"Huns, raided every summer into the settled parts of Europe.  In"
45,7547,"938 they went through Germany into France, crossed the Alps into"
45,7548,"North Italy, and so came home, burning, robbing and destroying."
45,7550,Finally pounding away from the south at the vestiges of the {264}
45,7551,Roman Empire were the Saracens.  They had made themselves largely
45,7552,masters of the sea; their only formidable adversaries upon the
45,7553,"water were the Northmen, the Russian Northmen out of the Black Sea"
45,7554,and the Northmen of the west.
45,7558,"Hemmed in by these more vigorous and aggressive peoples, amidst"
45,7559,forces they did not understand and dangers they could not
45,7560,"estimate, Charlemagne and after him a series of other ambitious"
45,7561,spirits took up the futile drama of restoring the Western Empire
45,7562,under the name of the Holy Roman Empire.  From the time of
45,7563,Charlemagne onward this idea obsessed the political life of
45,7564,"Western Europe, while in the East the Greek half of the Roman"
45,7565,power decayed and dwindled until at last nothing remained of it at
45,7566,all but the corrupt trading city of Constantinople and a few miles
45,7567,of territory about it.  Politically the continent of Europe
45,7568,remained traditional and uncreative from the time of Charlemagne
45,7569,onward for a thousand years.
45,7573,The name of Charlemagne looms large in European history but his
45,7574,personality is but indistinctly seen.  He could not read nor
45,7575,"write, but he had a considerable respect for learning; he liked to"
45,7576,be read aloud to at meals and he had a weakness for theological
45,7577,discussion.  At his winter quarters at
45,7578,Aix-la-Chapelle or Mayence he gathered about him a number of
45,7579,learned men and picked up much from their conversation.  In the
45,7580,"summer he made war, against the Spanish Saracens, against the"
45,7581,"Slavs and Magyars, against the Saxons, and other still heathen"
45,7582,German tribes.  It is doubtful whether the idea of becoming Caesar
45,7583,in succession to Romulus Augustulus occurred to him before his
45,7584,"acquisition of North Italy, or whether it was suggested to him by"
45,7585,"Pope Leo III, who was anxious to make the Latin Church independent"
45,7586,of Constantinople.
45,7588,There were the most extraordinary manoeuvres at Rome between the
45,7589,Pope and the prospective emperor in order to make it appear or not
45,7590,appear as if the Pope gave him the imperial crown.  The Pope
45,7591,succeeded in crowning his visitor and conqueror by surprise in St.
45,7592,"Peter's on Christmas Day 800 A.D.  He produced a crown, put it on"
45,7593,the head of Charlemagne and hailed him Caesar and Augustus.  There
45,7594,was great applause among the people.  Charlemagne was by no means
45,7595,"pleased at the way in which the thing was done, it rankled in his"
45,7596,mind as a defeat; and he left the most careful instructions to his
45,7597,son that he was not to let the Pope crown him emperor; he was to
45,7598,seize the crown into his own hands and put it on his own head
45,7599,himself.  So at the very outset of this imperial revival we see
45,7600,beginning the age-long dispute of Pope and Emperor for priority.
45,7601,"But Louis the Pious, the son of Charlemagne, disregarded his"
45,7602,father's instructions and was entirely submissive to the Pope.
45,7604,The empire of Charlemagne fell apart at the death of Louis the
45,7605,Pious and the split between the French-speaking Franks and the
45,7606,German-speaking Franks widened.  The next emperor to arise was
45,7607,"Otto, the son of a certain Henry the Fowler, a Saxon, who had been"
45,7608,elected King of Germany by an assembly of German princes and
45,7609,prelates in 919.  Otto descended upon Rome and was crowned emperor
45,7610,there in 962.  This Saxon line came to an end early in the
45,7611,eleventh century and gave place to other German rulers.  The
45,7612,feudal princes and nobles to the west who spoke various French
45,7613,dialects {266} did not fall under the sway of these German
45,7614,"emperors after the Carlovingian line, the line that is descended"
45,7615,"from Charlemagne, had come to an end, and no part of Britain ever"
45,7616,"came into the Holy Roman Empire.  The Duke of Normandy, the King"
45,7617,of France and a number of lesser feudal rulers remained outside.
45,7618,In 987 the Kingdom of France passed out of the possession of the
45,7619,"Carlovingian line into the hands of Hugh Capet, whose descendants"
45,7620,were still reigning in the eighteenth century.  At the time of
45,7621,Hugh Capet the King of France ruled only a comparatively small
45,7622,territory round Paris.
45,7624,In 1066 England was attacked almost simultaneously by an invasion
45,7625,of the Norwegian Northmen under King Harold Hardrada and by the
45,7626,Latinized Northmen under the Duke of Normandy.  Harold King of
45,7627,"England defeated the former at the battle of Stamford Bridge, and"
45,7628,was defeated by the latter at Hastings.  England was conquered by
45,7629,"the Normans, and so cut off from Scandinavian, Teutonic and"
45,7630,"Russian affairs, and brought into the most intimate relations and"
45,7631,conflicts with the French.  For the next four centuries the
45,7632,English were entangled in the conflicts of the French feudal
45,7633,princes and wasted upon the fields of France.
46,7645,It is interesting to note that Charlemagne corresponded with the
46,7646,"Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, the Haroun-al-Raschid of the _Arabian"
46,7647,Nights_.  It is recorded that Haroun-al-Raschid sent ambassadors
46,7648,from Bagdad--which had now replaced Damascus as the Moslem
46,7649,"capital--with a splendid tent, a water clock, an elephant and the"
46,7650,keys of the Holy Sepulchre.  This latter present was admirably
46,7651,calculated to set the Byzantine Empire and this new Holy Roman
46,7652,Empire by the ears as to which was the proper protector of the
46,7653,Christians in Jerusalem.
46,7655,These presents remind us that while Europe in the ninth century
46,7656,"was still a weltering disorder of war and pillage, there"
46,7657,"flourished a great Arab Empire in Egypt and Mesopotamia, far more"
46,7658,civilized than anything Europe could show.  Here literature and
46,7659,"science still lived; the arts flourished, and the mind of man"
46,7660,could move without fear or superstition.  And even in Spain and
46,7661,North Africa where the Saracenic dominions were falling into
46,7662,political confusion there was a vigorous intellectual life.
46,7663,Aristotle was read and discussed by these Jews and Arabs during
46,7664,these centuries of European darkness.  They guarded the neglected
46,7665,seeds of science and philosophy.
46,7667,North-east of the Caliph's dominions was a number of Turkish
46,7668,"tribes.  They had been converted to Islam, and they held the faith"
46,7669,much more simply and fiercely than the actively intellectual Arabs
46,7670,and Persians to the south.  In the tenth century the Turks were
46,7671,growing strong and vigorous while the Arab power was divided and
46,7672,decaying.  The relations of the Turks to the Empire of the
46,7673,Caliphate became very similar to the relations of the Medes to the
46,7674,last Babylonian Empire fourteen centuries before.  In the eleventh
46,7675,"century a group of Turkish tribes, the Seljuk Turks, came down"
46,7676,into Mesopotamia and made the Caliph their nominal ruler but
46,7677,really their {268} captive and tool.  They conquered Armenia.
46,7678,Then they struck at the remnants of the Byzantine power in Asia
46,7679,Minor.  In 1071 the Byzantine army was utterly smashed at the
46,7680,"battle of Melasgird, and the Turks swept forward until not a trace"
46,7681,of Byzantine rule remained in Asia.  They took the fortress of
46,7682,"Nicaea over against Constantinople, and prepared to attempt that"
46,7683,city.
46,7685,"The Byzantine emperor, Michael VII, was overcome with terror.  He"
46,7686,was already heavily engaged in warfare with a band of Norman
46,7687,"adventurers who had seized Durazzo, and with a fierce Turkish"
46,7688,"people, the Petschenegs, who were raiding over the Danube.  In his"
46,7689,"extremity he sought help where he could, and it is notable that he"
46,7690,did not appeal to the western emperor but to the Pope of Rome as
46,7691,"the head of Latin Christendom.  He wrote to Pope Gregory VII, and"
46,7692,his successor Alexius Comnenus wrote still more urgently to Urban
46,7693,II.
46,7697,This was not a quarter of a century from the rupture of the Latin
46,7698,and Greek churches.  That controversy was still vividly alive in
46,7699,"men's minds, and this disaster to Byzantium must have presented"
46,7700,itself to the Pope as a supreme opportunity for reasserting the
46,7701,supremacy of the Latin Church over the dissentient Greeks.
46,7702,Moreover this occasion gave the Pope a chance to deal with two
46,7703,other matters that troubled western Christendom very greatly.  One
46,7704,"was the custom of ""private war"" which disordered social life, and"
46,7705,the other was the superabundant fighting energy of the Low Germans
46,7706,and Christianized Northmen and particularly of the Franks and
46,7707,"Normans.  A religious war, the Crusade, the War of the Cross, was"
46,7708,"{269} preached against the Turkish captors of Jerusalem, and a"
46,7709,truce to all warfare amongst Christians (1095).  The declared
46,7710,object of this war was the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre from the
46,7711,unbelievers.  A man called Peter the Hermit carried on a popular
46,7712,propaganda throughout France and Germany on broadly democratic
46,7713,"lines.  He went clad in a coarse garment, barefooted on an ass, he"
46,7714,carried a huge cross and harangued the crowd in street or
46,7715,market-place or church.  He denounced the cruelties practised upon
46,7716,"the Christian pilgrims by the Turks, and the shame of the Holy"
46,7717,Sepulchre being in any but Christian hands.  The fruits of
46,7718,centuries of Christian teaching became apparent in the response.
46,7719,"A great wave of enthusiasm swept the western world, and popular"
46,7720,Christendom discovered itself.
46,7724,Such a widespread uprising of the common people in relation to a
46,7725,single idea as now occurred was a new thing in the history of our
46,7726,race.  There is nothing to parallel it in the previous history of
46,7727,"the {270} Roman Empire or of India or China.  On a smaller scale,"
46,7728,"however, there had been similar movements among the Jewish people"
46,7729,"after their liberation from the Babylonian captivity, and later on"
46,7730,Islam was to display a parallel susceptibility to collective
46,7731,feeling.  Such movements were certainly connected with the new
46,7732,spirit that had come into life with the development of the
46,7733,"missionary-teaching religions.  The Hebrew prophets, Jesus and his"
46,7734,"disciples, Mani, Muhammad, were all exhorters of men's individual"
46,7735,souls.  They brought the personal conscience face to face with
46,7736,God.  Before that time religion had been much more a business of
46,7737,"fetish, of pseudoscience, than of conscience.  The old kind of"
46,7738,"religion turned upon temple, initiated priest and mystical"
46,7739,"sacrifice, and ruled the common man like a slave by fear.  The new"
46,7740,kind of religion made a man of him.
46,7742,The preaching of the First Crusade was the first stirring of the
46,7743,common people in European history.  It may be too much to call it
46,7744,"the birth of modern democracy, but certainly at that time modern"
46,7745,democracy stirred.  Before very long we shall find it stirring
46,7746,"again, and raising the most disturbing social and religious"
46,7747,questions.
46,7749,Certainly this first stirring of democracy ended very pitifully
46,7750,"and lamentably.  Considerable bodies of common people, crowds"
46,7751,"rather than armies, set out eastward from France and the Rhineland"
46,7752,and Central Europe without waiting for leaders or proper equipment
46,7753,"to rescue the Holy Sepulchre.  This was the ""people's crusade."""
46,7754,"Two great mobs blundered into Hungary, mistook the recently"
46,7755,"converted Magyars for pagans, committed atrocities and were"
46,7756,"massacred.  A third multitude with a similarly confused mind,"
46,7757,"after a great pogrom of the Jews in the Rhineland, marched"
46,7758,"eastward, and was also destroyed in Hungary.  Two other huge"
46,7759,"crowds, under the leadership of Peter the Hermit himself, reached"
46,7760,"Constantinople, crossed the Bosphorus, and were massacred rather"
46,7761,than defeated by the Seljuk Turks.  So began and ended this first
46,7762,"movement of the European people, as people."
46,7764,Next year (1097) the real fighting forces crossed the Bosphorus.
46,7765,Essentially they were Norman in leadership and spirit.  They
46,7766,"stormed Nicaea, marched by much the same route as Alexander had"
46,7767,"followed fourteen centuries before, to Antioch.  The siege of"
46,7768,"Antioch {271} kept them a year, and in June 1099 they invested"
46,7769,Jerusalem.  It was stormed after a month's siege.  The slaughter
46,7770,was terrible.  Men riding on horseback were splashed by the blood
46,7771,in the streets.  At nightfall on July 15th the Crusaders had
46,7772,fought their way into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and
46,7773,"overcome all opposition there: blood-stained, weary and ""sobbing"
46,7774,"from excess of joy"" they knelt down in prayer."
46,7778,Immediately the hostility of Latin and Greek broke out again.  The
46,7779,"Crusaders were the servants of the Latin Church, and the Greek"
46,7780,patriarch of Jerusalem found himself in a far worse case under the
46,7781,triumphant Latins than under the Turks.  The Crusaders discovered
46,7782,themselves between Byzantine and Turk and fighting both.  Much of
46,7783,"Asia Minor was recovered by the Byzantine Empire, and the Latin"
46,7784,"princes were left, a buffer between Turk and Greek, with Jerusalem"
46,7785,"and a few small principalities, of which Edessa was one of the"
46,7786,"chief, in Syria.  Their grip even on these possessions was"
46,7787,"precarious, and in 1144 Edessa fell to the Moslim, leading to an"
46,7788,"ineffective Second Crusade, which failed to recover Edessa but"
46,7789,saved Antioch from a similar fate.
46,7793,In 1169 the forces of Islam were rallied under a Kurdish
46,7794,adventurer named Saladin who had made himself master of Egypt.  He
46,7795,"preached a Holy War against the Christians, recaptured Jerusalem"
46,7796,"in 1187, and so provoked the Third Crusade.  This failed to"
46,7797,recover Jerusalem.  In the Fourth Crusade (1202-4) the Latin
46,7798,"Church turned frankly upon the Greek Empire, and there was not"
46,7799,even a pretence of fighting the Turks.  It started from Venice and
46,7800,in 1204 it stormed Constantinople.  The great rising trading city
46,7801,"of Venice was the leader in this adventure, and most of the coasts"
46,7802,and islands of the Byzantine Empire were annexed by the Venetians.
46,7803,"A ""Latin"" emperor (Baldwin of Flanders) was set up in"
46,7804,Constantinople and the Latin and Greek Church were declared to be
46,7805,reunited.  The Latin emperors ruled in Constantinople from 1204 to
46,7806,1261 when the Greek world shook itself free again from Roman
46,7807,predominance.
46,7809,The twelfth century then and the opening of the thirteenth was the
46,7810,age of papal ascendancy just as the eleventh was the age of the
46,7811,ascendancy of the Seljuk Turks and the tenth the age of the
46,7812,Northmen.  A united Christendom under the rule of the Pope came
46,7813,nearer to being a working reality than it ever was before or after
46,7814,that time.
46,7816,In those centuries a simple Christian faith was real and
46,7817,widespread over great areas of Europe.  Rome itself had passed
46,7818,through some dark and discreditable phases; few writers can be
46,7819,found to excuse the lives of Popes John XI and John XII in the
46,7820,tenth century; they were abominable creatures; but the heart and
46,7821,body of Latin Christendom had remained earnest and simple; the
46,7822,generality of the common priests and monks and nuns had lived
46,7823,exemplary and faithful lives.  Upon the wealth of confidence such
46,7824,lives created rested the power of the church.  Among the great
46,7825,"Popes of the past had been Gregory the Great, Gregory I (590-604)"
46,7826,and Leo III (795-816) who invited Charlemagne to be Caesar and
46,7827,crowned him in spite of himself.  Towards the close of the
46,7828,"eleventh century there arose a great clerical statesman,"
46,7829,"Hildebrand, who ended his life as Pope Gregory VII (1073-1085)."
46,7830,"Next but one after him came Urban II (1087-1099), the Pope of the"
46,7831,First Crusade.  These two were the founders of this period of
46,7832,papal greatness during which the Popes lorded it over the
46,7833,Emperors.  From Bulgaria to Ireland and {274} from Norway to
46,7834,Sicily and Jerusalem the Pope was supreme.  Gregory VII obliged
46,7835,the Emperor Henry IV to come in penitence to him at Canossa and to
46,7836,await forgiveness for three days and nights in the courtyard of
46,7837,"the castle, clad in sackcloth and barefooted to the snow.  In 1176"
46,7838,"at Venice the Emperor Frederick (Frederick Barbarossa), knelt to"
46,7839,Pope Alexander III and swore fealty to him.
46,7849,The great power of the church in the beginning of the eleventh
46,7850,century lay in the wills and consciences of men.  It failed to
46,7851,retain the moral prestige on which its power was based.  In the
46,7852,opening decades of the fourteenth century it was discovered that
46,7853,the power of the Pope had evaporated.  What was it that destroyed
46,7854,the naive confidence of the common people of Christendom in the
46,7855,church so that they would no longer rally to its appeal and serve
46,7856,its purposes?
46,7858,The first trouble was certainly the accumulation of wealth by the
46,7859,"church.  The church never died, and there was a frequent"
46,7860,disposition on the part of dying childless people to leave lands
46,7861,to the church.  Penitent sinners were exhorted to do so.
46,7862,Accordingly in many European countries as much as a fourth of the
46,7863,land became church property.  The appetite for property grows with
46,7864,what it feeds upon.  Already in the thirteenth century it was
46,7865,"being said everywhere that the priests were not good men, that"
46,7866,they were always hunting for money and legacies.
46,7868,The kings and princes disliked this alienation of property very
46,7869,greatly.  In the place of feudal lords capable of military
46,7870,"support, they found their land supporting abbeys and monks and"
46,7871,nuns.  And these lands were really under foreign dominion.  Even
46,7872,before the time of Pope Gregory VII there had been a struggle
46,7873,between the princes and the papacy over the question of
46,7874,"""investitures,"" the question that is of who should appoint the"
46,7875,"bishops.  If that power rested with the Pope and not the King,"
46,7876,then the latter lost control not only of the consciences of his
46,7877,subjects but of a considerable part of his dominions.  For also
46,7878,the clergy claimed exemption from taxation.  They paid their taxes
46,7879,"to Rome.  And not only that, but the church also claimed the right"
46,7880,to levy a tax of one-tenth upon the property of the layman in
46,7881,addition to the taxes he paid his prince.
46,7885,The history of nearly every country in Latin Christendom tells of
46,7886,"the same phase in the eleventh century, a phase of struggle"
46,7887,between monarch and Pope on the issue of investitures and
46,7888,generally it tells of a victory for the Pope.  He claimed to be
46,7889,"able to excommunicate the prince, to absolve his subjects from"
46,7890,"their allegiance to him, to recognize a successor.  He claimed to"
46,7891,"be able to put a nation under an interdict, and then nearly all"
46,7892,"priestly functions ceased except the sacraments of baptism,"
46,7893,confirmation and penance; the priests could neither hold the
46,7894,"ordinary services, marry people, nor bury the dead.  With these"
46,7895,two weapons it was possible for the twelfth century Popes to curb
46,7896,the most recalcitrant princes and overawe the most restive
46,7897,"peoples.  These were enormous powers, and enormous powers are only"
46,7898,to be used on extraordinary occasions.  The Popes used them at
46,7899,last with a frequency that staled their effect.  Within thirty
46,7900,"years at the end of the twelfth century we find Scotland, France"
46,7901,and England in turn under an interdict.  And also the Popes could
46,7902,not resist the temptation to preach crusades against offending
46,7903,princes--until the crusading spirit was extinct.
46,7905,It is possible that if the Church of Rome had struggled simply
46,7906,against the princes and had had a care to keep its hold upon the
46,7907,"general mind, it might have achieved a permanent dominion over all"
46,7908,Christendom.  But the high claims of the Pope were reflected as
46,7909,arrogance in the conduct of the clergy.  Before the eleventh
46,7910,century the Roman priests could marry; they had close ties with
46,7911,the people among whom they lived; they were indeed a part of the
46,7912,people.  Gregory VII made them celibates; he cut the priests off
46,7913,from too great an intimacy with the laymen in order to bind them
46,7914,"more closely to Rome, but indeed he opened a fissure between the"
46,7915,church and the commonalty.  The church had its own law courts.
46,7916,"Cases involving not merely priests but monks, students, crusaders,"
46,7917,"widows, orphans and the helpless were reserved for the clerical"
46,7918,"courts, and so were all matters relating to wills, marriages and"
46,7919,"oaths and all cases of sorcery, heresy and blasphemy.  Whenever"
46,7920,the layman found himself in conflict with the priest he had to go
46,7921,to a clerical court.  The obligations of peace and war fell upon
46,7922,his shoulders alone and left the priest free.  It is no great
46,7923,wonder that jealousy and hatred of the priests grew up in the
46,7924,Christian world.
46,7928,Never did Rome seem to realize that its power was in the
46,7929,consciences of common men.  It fought against religious
46,7930,"enthusiasm, which should have been its ally, and it forced"
46,7931,doctrinal orthodoxy upon honest doubt and aberrant opinion.  When
46,7932,the church interfered in matters of morality it had the common man
46,7933,"with it, but not when it interfered in matters of doctrine.  When"
46,7934,in the south of France Waldo taught a return to the simplicity of
46,7935,"Jesus in faith and life, Innocent III preached a crusade against"
46,7936,"the Waldenses, Waldo's followers, and permitted them to be"
46,7937,"suppressed with fire, sword, rape and the most abominable"
46,7938,cruelties.  When again St. Francis of Assisi
46,7939,(1181-1226) taught the imitation of Christ and a life of poverty
46,7940,"and service, his followers, the Franciscans, were persecuted,"
46,7941,"scourged, imprisoned and dispersed.  In 1318 four of them were"
46,7942,burnt alive at Marseilles.  On the other hand the fiercely
46,7943,"orthodox order of the Dominicans, founded by St. Dominic"
46,7944,"(1170-1221) was strongly supported by Innocent III, who with its"
46,7945,"assistance set up an organization, the Inquisition, for the"
46,7946,hunting of heresy and the affliction of free thought.
46,7948,"So it was that the church by excessive claims, by unrighteous"
46,7949,"privileges, and by an irrational intolerance destroyed that free"
46,7950,faith of the common man which was the final source of all its
46,7951,power.  The story of its decline tells of no adequate foemen from
46,7952,without but continually of decay from within.
47,7964,One very great weakness of the Roman Church in its struggle to
47,7965,secure the headship of all Christendom was the manner in which the
47,7966,Pope was chosen.
47,7968,If indeed the papacy was to achieve its manifest ambition and
47,7969,"establish one rule and one peace throughout Christendom, then it"
47,7970,"was vitally necessary that it should have a strong, steady and"
47,7971,continuous direction.  In those great days of its opportunity it
47,7972,needed before all things that the Popes when they took office
47,7973,"should be able men in the prime of life, that each should have his"
47,7974,successor-designate with whom he could discuss the policy of the
47,7975,"church, and that the forms and processes of election should be"
47,7976,"clear, definite, unalterable and unassailable.  Unhappily none of"
47,7977,these things obtained.  It was not even clear who could vote in
47,7978,"the election of a Pope, nor whether the Byzantine or Holy Roman"
47,7979,Emperor had a voice in the matter.  That very great papal
47,7980,"statesman Hildebrand (Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085) did much to"
47,7981,regularize the election.  He confined the votes to the Roman
47,7982,cardinals and he reduced the Emperor's share to a formula of
47,7983,"assent conceded to him by the church, but he made no provision for"
47,7984,a successor-designate and he left it possible for the disputes of
47,7985,"the cardinals to keep the See vacant, as in some cases it was kept"
47,7986,"vacant, for a year or more."
47,7988,The consequences of this want of firm definition are to be seen in
47,7989,the whole history of the papacy up to the sixteenth century.  From
47,7990,quite early times onward there were disputed elections and two or
47,7991,more men each claiming to be Pope.  The church would then be
47,7992,subjected to the indignity of going to the Emperor or some other
47,7993,outside arbiter to settle the dispute.  And the career of everyone
47,7994,of the great Popes ended in a note of interrogation.  At his death
47,7995,the church might be left headless and as ineffective as a
47,7996,decapitated {279} body.  Or he might be replaced by some old rival
47,7997,eager only to discredit and undo his work.  Or some enfeebled old
47,7998,man tottering on the brink of the grave might succeed him.
47,8008,It was inevitable that this peculiar weakness of the papal
47,8009,organization should attract the interference of the various German
47,8010,"princes, the French King, and the Norman and French Kings who"
47,8011,ruled in England; that they should all try to influence the
47,8012,"elections, and have a Pope in their own interest established in"
47,8013,the Lateran Palace at Rome.  And the more powerful and important
47,8014,"the Pope became in European affairs, the more urgent did these"
47,8015,interventions become.  Under the circumstances it is no great
47,8016,wonder that many of the Popes were weak and futile.  The
47,8017,astonishing thing is that many of them were able and courageous
47,8018,men.
47,8020,One of the most vigorous and interesting of the Popes of this
47,8021,great period was Innocent III (1198-1216) who was so fortunate as
47,8022,to become Pope before he was thirty-eight.  He and his successors
47,8023,"were pitted against an even more interesting personality, the"
47,8024,"Emperor Frederick II; _Stupor mundi_ he was called, the Wonder of"
47,8025,the world.  The struggle of this monarch against Rome is a turning
47,8026,place in history.  In the end Rome defeated him and destroyed his
47,8027,"dynasty, but he left the prestige of the church and Pope so badly"
47,8028,wounded that its wounds festered and led to its decay.
47,8030,Frederick was the son of the Emperor Henry VI and his mother was
47,8031,"the daughter of Roger I, the Norman King of Sicily.  He inherited"
47,8032,this kingdom in 1198 when he was a child of four years.  Innocent
47,8033,III had been made his guardian.  Sicily in those days had been but
47,8034,recently conquered by the Normans; the Court was half oriental and
47,8035,full of highly educated Arabs; and some of these were associated
47,8036,in the education of the young king.  No doubt they were at some
47,8037,pains to make their point of view clear to him.  He got a Moslem
47,8038,"view of Christianity as well as a Christian view of Islam, and the"
47,8039,"unhappy result of this double system of instruction was a view,"
47,8040,"exceptional in that age of faith, that all religions were"
47,8041,impostures.  He talked freely on the subject; his heresies and
47,8042,blasphemies are on record.
47,8044,As the young man grew up he found himself in conflict with his
47,8045,guardian.  Innocent III wanted altogether too much from his ward.
47,8046,{280} When the opportunity came for Frederick to succeed as
47,8047,"Emperor, the Pope intervened with conditions.  Frederick must"
47,8048,promise to put down heresy in Germany with a strong hand. Moreover
47,8049,"he must relinquish his crown in Sicily and South Italy, because"
47,8050,otherwise he would be too strong for the Pope.  And the German
47,8051,clergy were to be freed from all taxation.  Frederick agreed but
47,8052,with no intention of keeping his word.  The Pope had already
47,8053,induced the French King to make war upon his own subjects in
47,8054,"France, the cruel and bloody crusade against the Waldenses; he"
47,8055,wanted Frederick to do the same thing in Germany.  But Frederick
47,8056,being far more of a heretic than any of the simple pietists who
47,8057,"had incurred the Pope's animosity, lacked the crusading impulse."
47,8058,And when Innocent urged him to crusade against the Moslim and
47,8059,recover Jerusalem he was equally ready to promise and equally
47,8060,slack in his performance.
47,8064,"Having secured the imperial crown Frederick II stayed in Sicily,"
47,8065,"which he greatly preferred to Germany as a residence, and did"
47,8066,"nothing to redeem any of his promises to Innocent III, who died"
47,8067,baffled in 1216.
47,8071,"Honorius III, who succeeded Innocent, could do no better with"
47,8072,"Frederick, and Gregory IX (1227) came to the papal throne"
47,8073,evidently resolved to settle accounts with this young man at any
47,8074,cost.  He excommunicated him.  Frederick II was denied all the
47,8075,comforts of religion.  In the half-Arab Court of Sicily this
47,8076,produced singularly little discomfort.  And also the Pope
47,8077,addressed a public letter to the Emperor reciting his vices (which
47,8078,"were indisputable), his heresies, and his general misconduct.  To"
47,8079,this Frederick replied in a document of diabolical ability.  It
47,8080,"was addressed to all the princes of Europe, and it made the first"
47,8081,clear statement of the issue between the Pope and the princes.  He
47,8082,made a shattering attack upon the manifest ambition of the Pope to
47,8083,become the absolute ruler of all Europe.  He suggested a union of
47,8084,princes against this usurpation.   He directed the attention of
47,8085,the princes specifically to the wealth of the church.
47,8087,Having fired off this deadly missile Frederick resolved to perform
47,8088,his twelve-year-old promise and go upon a crusade.  This was the
47,8089,"Sixth Crusade (1228).  It was as a crusade, farcical.  Frederick"
47,8090,II went to Egypt and met and discussed affairs with the Sultan.
47,8091,"These two gentlemen, both of sceptical opinions, exchanged"
47,8092,"congenial views, made a commercial convention to their mutual"
47,8093,"advantage, and agreed to transfer Jerusalem to Frederick.  This"
47,8094,"indeed was a new sort of crusade, a crusade by private treaty."
47,8095,"Here was no blood splashing the conqueror, no ""weeping with excess"
47,8096,"of joy.""  As this astonishing crusader was an excommunicated man,"
47,8097,he had to be content with a purely secular coronation as King of
47,8098,"Jerusalem, taking the crown from the altar with his own hand--for"
47,8099,"all the clergy were bound to shun him.  He then returned to Italy,"
47,8100,chased the papal armies which had invaded his dominions back to
47,8101,"their own territories, and obliged the Pope to grant him"
47,8102,absolution from his excommunication.  So a prince might treat the
47,8103,"Pope in the thirteenth century, and there was now no storm of"
47,8104,popular indignation to avenge him.  Those days were past.
47,8106,"In 1239 Gregory IX resumed his struggle with Frederick,"
47,8107,"excommunicated him for a second time, and renewed that warfare of"
47,8108,public abuse in which the papacy had already suffered severely.
47,8109,"The controversy was revived after Gregory IX was dead, when"
47,8110,"Innocent IV {282} was Pope; and again a devastating letter, which"
47,8111,"men were bound to remember, was written by Frederick against the"
47,8112,"church.  He denounced the pride and irreligion of the clergy, and"
47,8113,ascribed all the corruptions of the time to their pride and
47,8114,wealth.  He proposed to his fellow princes a general confiscation
47,8115,of church property--for the good of the church.  It was a
47,8116,suggestion that never afterwards left the imagination of the
47,8117,European princes.
47,8119,We will not go on to tell of his last years.  The particular
47,8120,events of his life are far less significant than its general
47,8121,atmosphere.  It is possible to piece together something of his
47,8122,"court life in Sicily.  He was luxurious in his way of living, and"
47,8123,fond of beautiful things.  He is described as licentious.  But it
47,8124,is clear that he was a man of very effectual curiosity and
47,8125,inquiry.  He gathered Jewish and Moslem as well as Christian
47,8126,"philosophers at his court, and he did much to irrigate the Italian"
47,8127,mind with Saracenic influences.  Through him the Arabic numerals
47,8128,"and algebra were introduced to Christian students, and among other"
47,8129,"philosophers at his court was Michael Scott, who translated"
47,8130,portions of Aristotle and the commentaries thereon of the great
47,8131,Arab philosopher Averroes (of Cordoba).  In 1224 Frederick founded
47,8132,"the University of Naples, and he enlarged and enriched the great"
47,8133,medical school at Salerno University.  He also founded a
47,8134,"zoological garden.  He left a book on hawking, which shows him to"
47,8135,"have been an acute observer of the habits of birds, and he was one"
47,8136,of the first Italians to write Italian verse.  Italian poetry was
47,8137,"indeed born at his court.  He has been called by an able writer,"
47,8138,"""the first of the moderns,"" and the phrase expresses aptly the"
47,8139,unprejudiced detachment of his intellectual side.
47,8141,A still more striking intimation of the decay of the living and
47,8142,sustaining forces of the papacy appeared when presently the Popes
47,8143,came into conflict with the growing power of the French King.
47,8144,"During the lifetime of the Emperor Frederick II, Germany fell into"
47,8145,"disunion, and the French King began to play the role of guard,"
47,8146,supporter and rival to the Pope that had hitherto fallen to the
47,8147,Hohenstaufen Emperors.  A series of Popes pursued the policy of
47,8148,supporting the French monarchs.  French princes were established
47,8149,"in the kingdom of Sicily and Naples, with the support and approval"
47,8150,"of Rome, and the French Kings saw before them the possibility of"
47,8151,"{283} restoring and ruling the Empire of Charlemagne.  When,"
47,8152,"however, the German interregnum after the death of Frederick II,"
47,8153,"the last of the Hohenstaufens, came to all end and Rudolf of"
47,8154,"Habsburg was elected first Habsburg Emperor (1273), the policy of"
47,8155,"Rome began to fluctuate between France and Germany, veering about"
47,8156,with the sympathies of each successive Pope.  In the East in 1261
47,8157,"the Greeks recaptured Constantinople from the Latin emperors, and"
47,8158,"the founder of the new Greek dynasty, Michael Palaeologus, Michael"
47,8159,"VIII, after some unreal tentatives of reconciliation with the"
47,8160,"Pope, broke away from the Roman communion altogether, and with"
47,8161,"that, and the fall of the Latin kingdoms in Asia, the eastward"
47,8162,ascendancy of the Popes came to an end.
47,8167,"In 1294 Boniface VIII became Pope.  He was an Italian, hostile to"
47,8168,"the French, and full of a sense of the great traditions and"
47,8169,mission of Rome.  For a time he carried things with a high hand.
47,8170,"In 1300 he held a jubilee, and a vast multitude of pilgrims"
47,8171,"assembled in Rome.  ""So great was the influx of money into the"
47,8172,"papal treasury, that two assistants were kept busy with the rakes"
47,8173,collecting the {284} offerings that were deposited at the tomb of
47,8174,"St. Peter.""  [5]  But this festival was a delusive triumph."
47,8175,"Boniface came into conflict with the French King in 1302, and in"
47,8176,"1303, as he was about to pronounce sentence of excommunication"
47,8177,"against that  monarch, he was surprised and arrested in his own"
47,8178,"ancestral palace at Anagni, by Guillaume de Nogaret.  This agent"
47,8179,"from the French King forced an entrance into the palace, made his"
47,8180,way into the bedroom of the frightened Pope--he was lying in bed
47,8181,with a cross in his hands--and heaped threats and insults upon
47,8182,"him.  The Pope was liberated a day or so later by the townspeople,"
47,8183,and returned to Rome; but there he was seized upon and again made
47,8184,"prisoner by the Orsini family, and in a few weeks' time the"
47,8185,shocked and disillusioned old man died a prisoner in their hands.
47,8190,"The people of Anagni did resent the first outrage, and rose"
47,8191,"against Nogaret to liberate Boniface, but then Anagni was the"
47,8192,Pope's native town.  The important point to note is that the
47,8193,French King {285} in this rough treatment of the head of
47,8194,Christendom was acting with the full approval of his people; he
47,8195,"had summoned a council of the Three Estates of France (lords,"
47,8196,church and commons) and gained their consent before proceeding to
47,8197,"extremities.  Neither in Italy, Germany nor England was there the"
47,8198,slightest general manifestation of disapproval at this free
47,8199,handling of the sovereign pontiff.  The idea of Christendom had
47,8200,decayed until its power over the minds of men had gone.
47,8202,Throughout the fourteenth century the papacy did nothing to
47,8203,"recover its moral sway.  The next Pope elected, Clement V, was a"
47,8204,"Frenchman, the choice of King Philip of France.  He never came to"
47,8205,"Rome.  He set up his court in the town of Avignon, which then"
47,8206,"belonged not to France but to the papal See, though embedded in"
47,8207,"French territory, and there his successors remained until 1377,"
47,8208,when Pope Gregory XI returned to the Vatican palace in Rome.  But
47,8209,Gregory XI did not take the sympathies of the whole church with
47,8210,him.  Many of the cardinals were of French origin and their habits
47,8211,and associations were rooted deep at Avignon.  When in 1378
47,8212,"Gregory XI died, and an Italian, Urban VI, was elected, these"
47,8213,"dissentient cardinals declared the election invalid, and elected"
47,8214,"another Pope, the anti-Pope, Clement VII.  This split is called"
47,8215,"the Great Schism.  The Popes remained in Rome, and all the"
47,8216,"anti-French powers, the Emperor, the King of England, Hungary,"
47,8217,Poland and the North of Europe were loyal to them.  The
47,8218,"anti-Popes, on the other hand, continued in Avignon, and were"
47,8219,"supported by the King of France, his ally the King of Scotland,"
47,8220,"Spain, Portugal and various German princes.  Each Pope"
47,8221,excommunicated and cursed the adherents of his rival (1378-1417).
47,8223,Is it any wonder that presently all over Europe people began to
47,8224,think for themselves in matters of religion?
47,8226,"The beginnings of the Franciscans and the Dominicans, which we"
47,8227,"have noted in the preceding chapters, were but two among many of"
47,8228,"the new forces that were arising in Christendom, either to hold or"
47,8229,shatter the church as its own wisdom might decide.
47,8230,"Those two orders the church did assimilate and use, though with a"
47,8231,little violence in the case of the former.  But other forces were
47,8232,more frankly disobedient and critical.  A century and a half later
47,8233,{286} came Wycliffe (1320-1384). He was a learned Doctor at
47,8234,Oxford.  Quite late in his life he began a series of outspoken
47,8235,criticisms of the corruption of the clergy and the unwisdom of the
47,8236,"church.  He organized a number of poor priests, the Wycliffites,"
47,8237,to spread his ideas throughout England; and in order that people
47,8238,"should judge between the church and himself, he translated the"
47,8239,Bible into English.  He was a more learned and far abler man than
47,8240,either St. Francis or St. Dominic.  He had supporters in high
47,8241,places and a great following among the people; and though Rome
47,8242,"raged against him, and ordered his imprisonment, he died a free"
47,8243,man.  But the black and ancient spirit that was leading the
47,8244,Catholic Church to its destruction would not let his bones rest in
47,8245,"the grave.  By a decree of the Council of Constance in 1415, his"
47,8246,"remains were ordered to be dug up and burnt, an order which was"
47,8247,carried out at the command of Pope Martin V by Bishop Fleming in
47,8248,1428.  This desecration was not the act of some isolated fanatic;
47,8249,it was the official act of the church.
48,8263,"But in the thirteenth century, while this strange and finally"
48,8264,ineffectual struggle to unify Christendom under the rule of the
48,8265,"Pope was going on in Europe, far more momentous events were afoot"
48,8266,upon the larger stage of Asia.  A Turkish people from the country
48,8267,to the north of China rose suddenly to prominence in the world's
48,8268,"affairs, and achieved such a series of conquests as has no"
48,8269,parallel in history.  These were the Mongols.  At the opening of
48,8270,"the thirteenth century they were a horde of nomadic horsemen,"
48,8271,"living very much as their predecessors, the Huns, had done,"
48,8272,subsisting chiefly upon meat and mare's milk and living in tents
48,8273,"of skin.  They had shaken themselves free from Chinese dominion,"
48,8274,and brought a number of other Turkish tribes into a military
48,8275,confederacy.  Their central camp was at Karakorum in Mongolia.
48,8277,At this time China was in a state of division.  The great dynasty
48,8278,"of Tang had passed into decay by the tenth century, and after a"
48,8279,"phase of division into warring states, three main empires, that of"
48,8280,Kin in the north with Pekin as its capital and that of Sung in the
48,8281,"south with a capital at Nankin, and Hsia in the centre, remain."
48,8282,"In 1214 Jengis Khan, the leader of the Mongol confederates, made"
48,8283,war on the Kin Empire and captured Pekin (1214).  He then turned
48,8284,"westward and conquered Western Turkestan, Persia, Armenia, India"
48,8285,"down to Lahore, and South Russia as far as Kieff.  He died master"
48,8286,of a vast empire that reached from the Pacific to the Dnieper.
48,8288,"His successor, Ogdai Khan, continued this astonishing career of"
48,8289,conquest.  His armies were organized to a very high level of
48,8290,"efficiency; and they had with them a new Chinese invention,"
48,8291,"gunpowder, which they used in small field guns.  He completed the"
48,8292,conquest of the Kin Empire and then swept his hosts right across
48,8293,"Asia to Russia (1235), an altogether amazing march.  Kieff was"
48,8294,"{288} destroyed in 1240, and nearly all Russia became tributary to"
48,8295,"the Mongols.  Poland was ravaged, and a mixed army of Poles and"
48,8296,Germans was annihilated at the battle of Liegnitz in Lower Silesia
48,8297,in 1241.  The Emperor Frederick II does not seem to have made any
48,8298,great efforts to stay the advancing tide.
48,8302,"""It is only recently,"" says Bury in his notes to Gibbon's _Decline"
48,8303,"and Fall of the Roman Empire_, ""that European history has begun to"
48,8304,understand that the successes of the Mongol army which overran
48,8305,Poland and occupied Hungary in the spring of A.D. 1241 were won by
48,8306,consummate strategy and were not due to a mere overwhelming
48,8307,superiority of numbers.  But this fact has not yet become a matter
48,8308,of common knowledge; the vulgar opinion which represents the
48,8309,Tartars as a wild horde carrying all before them solely by their
48,8310,"multitude, and galloping through Eastern Europe without a"
48,8311,"strategic plan, rushing at all obstacles and overcoming them by"
48,8312,"mere weight, still prevails. . . ."
48,8314,"""It was wonderful how punctually and effectually the arrangements"
48,8315,were carried out in operations extending from the Lower Vistula to
48,8316,Transylvania.  Such a campaign was quite beyond the {289} power of
48,8317,"any European army of the time, and it was beyond the vision of any"
48,8318,"European commander.  There was no general in Europe, from"
48,8319,"Frederick II downward, who was not a tyro in strategy compared to"
48,8320,Subutai.  It should also be noticed that the Mongols embarked upon
48,8321,the enterprise with full knowledge of the political situation of
48,8322,Hungary and the condition of Poland--they had taken care to inform
48,8323,"themselves by a well-organized system of spies; on the other hand,"
48,8324,"the Hungarians and the Christian powers, like childish barbarians,"
48,8325,"knew hardly anything about their enemies."""
48,8329,"But though the Mongols were victorious at Liegnitz, they did not"
48,8330,continue their drive westward.  They were getting into woodlands
48,8331,"and hilly country, which did not suit their tactics; and so they"
48,8332,"turned southward and prepared to settle in Hungary, massacring or"
48,8333,"assimilating the kindred Magyar, even as these had previously"
48,8334,massacred and assimilated the mixed Scythians and Avars and Huns
48,8335,before them.  From the Hungarian plain they would probably have
48,8336,made raids west and south as the Hungarians had done in the ninth
48,8337,"century, the Avars in the seventh and eighth and the Huns in the"
48,8338,"fifth.  But Ogdai died suddenly, and in 1242 there was trouble"
48,8339,"{290} about the succession, and recalled by this, the undefeated"
48,8340,hosts of Mongols began to pour back across Hungary and Roumania
48,8341,towards the east.
48,8343,Thereafter the Mongols concentrated their attention upon their
48,8344,Asiatic conquests.  By the middle of the thirteenth century they
48,8345,had conquered the Sung Empire.  Mangu Khan succeeded Ogdai Khan as
48,8346,"Great Khan in 1251, and made his brother Kublai Khan governor of"
48,8347,China.  In 1280 Kublai Khan had been formally recognized Emperor
48,8348,"of China, and so founded the Yuan dynasty which lasted until 1368."
48,8349,"While the last ruins of the Sung rule were going down in China,"
48,8350,"another brother of Mangu, Hulagu, was conquering Persia and Syria."
48,8351,"The Mongols displayed a bitter animosity to Islam at this time,"
48,8352,and not only massacred the population of Bagdad when they captured
48,8353,"that city, but set to work to destroy the immemorial irrigation"
48,8354,system which had kept Mesopotamia incessantly prosperous and
48,8355,populous from the early days of Sumeria.  From that time until our
48,8356,"own Mesopotamia has been a desert of ruins, sustaining only a"
48,8357,scanty population.  Into Egypt the Mongols never penetrated; the
48,8358,Sultan of Egypt completely defeated an army of Hulagu's in
48,8359,Palestine in 1260.
48,8361,After that disaster the tide of Mongol victory ebbed.  The
48,8362,dominions of the Great Khan fell into a number of separate states.
48,8363,"The eastern Mongols became Buddhists, like the Chinese; the"
48,8364,western became Moslim.  The Chinese threw off the rule of the Yuan
48,8365,"dynasty in 1368, and set up the native Ming dynasty which"
48,8366,flourished from 1368 to 1644.  The Russians remained tributary to
48,8367,"the Tartar hordes upon the south-east steppes until 1480, when the"
48,8368,Grand Duke of Moscow repudiated his allegiance and laid the
48,8369,foundation of modern Russia.
48,8371,In the fourteenth century there was a brief revival of Mongol
48,8372,"vigour under Timurlane, a descendant of Jengis Khan.  He"
48,8373,"established himself in Western Turkestan, assumed the title of"
48,8374,"Grand Khan in 1369, and conquered from Syria to Delhi.  He was the"
48,8375,most savage and destructive of all the Mongol conquerors.  He
48,8376,established an empire of desolation that did not survive his
48,8377,"death.  In 1505, however, a descendant of this Timur, an"
48,8378,"adventurer named Baber, got together an army with guns and swept"
48,8379,down upon the {292} plains of India.  His grandson Akbar
48,8380,"(1556-1605) completed his conquests, and this Mongol (or ""Mogul"""
48,8381,as the Arabs called it) dynasty ruled in Delhi over the greater
48,8382,part of India until the eighteenth century.
48,8395,One of the consequences of the first great sweep of Mongol
48,8396,conquest in the thirteenth century was to drive a certain tribe of
48,8397,"Turks, the Ottoman Turks, out of Turkestan into Asia Minor.  They"
48,8398,"extended and consolidated their power in Asia Minor, crossed the"
48,8399,"Dardanelles and conquered Macedonia, Serbia and Bulgaria, until at"
48,8400,last Constantinople remained like an island amongst the Ottoman
48,8401,"dominions.  In 1453 the Ottoman Sultan, Muhammad II, took"
48,8402,"Constantinople, attacking it from the European side with a great"
48,8403,number of guns.  This event caused intense excitement in Europe
48,8404,"and there was talk of a crusade, but the day of the crusades was"
48,8405,past.
48,8407,In the course of the sixteenth century the Ottoman Sultans
48,8408,"conquered Bagdad, Hungary, Egypt and most of North Africa, and"
48,8409,their fleet made them masters of the Mediterranean.  They very
48,8410,"nearly took Vienna, and they exacted it tribute from the Emperor."
48,8411,There were but two items to offset the general ebb of Christian
48,8412,{293} dominion in the fifteenth century.  One was the restoration
48,8413,of the independence of Moscow (1480); the other was the gradual
48,8414,"reconquest of Spain by the Christians. In 1492, Granada, the last"
48,8415,"Moslem state in the peninsula, fell to King Ferdinand of Aragon"
48,8416,and his Queen Isabella of Castile.
48,8418,But it was not until as late as 1571 that the naval battle of
48,8419,"Lepanto broke the prick of the Ottomans, and restored the"
48,8420,Mediterranean waters to Christian ascendancy.
49,8432,Throughout the twelfth century there were many signs that the
49,8433,"European intelligence was recovering courage and leisure, and"
49,8434,preparing to take up again the intellectual enterprises of the
49,8435,first Greek scientific enquiries and such speculations as those of
49,8436,the Italian Lucretius.  The causes of this revival were many and
49,8437,"complex.  The suppression of private war, the higher standards of"
49,8438,"comfort and security that followed the crusades, and the"
49,8439,stimulation of men's minds by the experiences of these expeditions
49,8440,were no doubt necessary preliminary conditions.  Trade was
49,8441,reviving; cities were recovering ease and safety; the standard of
49,8442,education was arising in the church and spreading among laymen.
49,8443,"The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were a period of growing,"
49,8444,"independent or quasi-independent cities; Venice, Florence, Genoa,"
49,8445,"Lisbon, Paris, Bruges, London, Antwerp, Hamburg, Nuremberg,"
49,8446,"Novgorod, Wisby and Bergen for example.  They were all trading"
49,8447,"cities with many travellers, and where men trade and travel they"
49,8448,"talk and think.  The polemics of the Popes and princes, the"
49,8449,conspicuous savagery and wickedness of the persecution of
49,8450,"heretics, were exciting men to doubt the authority of the church"
49,8451,and question and discuss fundamental things.
49,8453,We have seen how the Arabs were the means of restoring Aristotle
49,8454,"to Europe, and how such a prince as Frederick II acted as a"
49,8455,channel through which Arabic philosophy and science played upon
49,8456,the renascent European mind.  Still more influential in the
49,8457,stirring up of men's ideas were the Jews.  Their very existence
49,8458,was a note of interrogation to the claims of the church.  And
49,8459,"finally the secret, fascinating enquiries of the alchemists were"
49,8460,"spreading far and wide and setting men to the petty, furtive and"
49,8461,yet fruitful resumption of experimental science.
49,8465,And the stir in men's minds was by no means confined now to the
49,8466,independent and well educated.  The mind of the common man was
49,8467,awake in the world as it had never been before in all the
49,8468,"experience of mankind.  In spite of priest and persecution,"
49,8469,Christianity does seem to have carried a mental ferment wherever
49,8470,its teaching reached.  It established a direct relation between
49,8471,"the conscience of the individual man and the God of Righteousness,"
49,8472,so that now if need arose he had the courage to form his own
49,8473,judgment upon prince or prelate or creed.
49,8475,As early as the eleventh century philosophical discussion had
49,8476,"begun again in Europe, and there were great and growing"
49,8477,"universities at Paris, Oxford, Bologna and other centres.  There"
49,8478,"medieval ""schoolmen"" took up again and thrashed out a series of"
49,8479,questions upon the value and meaning of words that were a
49,8480,necessary preliminary to clear thinking in the scientific age that
49,8481,was to follow.  And standing by himself because of his distinctive
49,8482,"genius was Roger Bacon (circa 1210 to circa 1293), a Franciscan of"
49,8483,"Oxford, the father of modern experimental science.  His name"
49,8484,deserves a prominence in our history second only to that of
49,8485,Aristotle.
49,8487,His writings are one long tirade against ignorance.  He told his
49,8488,"age it was ignorant, an incredibly bold thing to do.  Nowadays a"
49,8489,"man may tell the world it is as silly as it is solemn, that all"
49,8490,its methods are still infantile and clumsy and its dogmas childish
49,8491,"assumptions, without much physical danger; but these peoples of"
49,8492,the middle ages when they were not actually being massacred or
49,8493,"starving or dying of pestilence, were passionately convinced of"
49,8494,"the wisdom, the completeness and finality of their beliefs, and"
49,8495,disposed to resent any reflections upon them very bitterly.  Roger
49,8496,Bacon's writings were like a flash of light in a profound
49,8497,darkness.  He combined his attack upon the ignorance of his times
49,8498,with a wealth of suggestion for the increase of knowledge.  In his
49,8499,passionate insistence upon the need of experiment and of
49,8500,"collecting knowledge, the spirit of Aristotle lives again in him."
49,8501,"""Experiment, experiment,"" that is the burthen of Roger Bacon."
49,8503,Yet of Aristotle himself Roger Bacon fell foul.  He fell foul of
49,8504,"him because men, instead of facing facts boldly, sat in rooms and"
49,8505,pored over the bad Latin translations which were then all that was
49,8506,"{296} available of the master.  ""If I had my way,"" he wrote, in"
49,8507,"his intemperate fashion, ""I should burn all the books of"
49,8508,"Aristotle, for the study of them can only lead to a loss of time,"
49,8509,"produce error, and increase ignorance,"" a sentiment that Aristotle"
49,8510,would probably have echoed could he have returned to a world in
49,8511,"which his works were not so much read as worshipped--and that, as"
49,8512,"Roger Bacon showed, in these most abominable translations."
49,8518,"Throughout his books, a little disguised by the necessity of"
49,8519,seeming to square it all with orthodoxy for fear of the prison and
49,8520,"worse, Roger Bacon shouted to mankind, ""Cease to be ruled by"
49,8521,"dogmas and authorities; _look at the world!_"" Four chief sources"
49,8522,"of ignorance he denounced; respect for authority, custom, the"
49,8523,"sense of the ignorant crowd, and the vain, proud unteachableness"
49,8524,"of our dispositions.  Overcome but these, and a world of power"
49,8525,would open to men:--
49,8527,"""Machines for navigating are possible without rowers, so that"
49,8528,"great ships suited to river or ocean, guided by one man, may be"
49,8529,borne with greater speed than if they were full of men.  Likewise
49,8530,cars may be made so that without a draught animal they may be
49,8531,"moved _cum impetu inoestimable_, as we deem the scythed chariots"
49,8532,to have been from which antiquity fought.  And flying machines are
49,8533,"possible, so that a man may sit in the middle turning some device"
49,8534,by which artificial wings may beat the air in the manner of a
49,8535,"flying bird."""
49,8537,"So Roger Bacon wrote, but three more centuries were to elapse"
49,8538,before men began any systematic attempts to explore the hidden
49,8539,stores of power and interest he realized so clearly existed
49,8540,beneath the dull surface of human affairs.
49,8542,But the Saracenic world not only gave Christendom the stimulus of
49,8543,its philosophers and alchemists; it also gave it paper.  It is
49,8544,scarcely too much to say that paper made the intellectual revival
49,8545,"of Europe possible.  Paper originated in China, where its use"
49,8546,probably goes back to the second century B.C.  In 751 the Chinese
49,8547,made an attack upon the Arab Moslems in Samarkand; they were
49,8548,"repulsed, and among the prisoners taken from them were some"
49,8549,"skilled papermakers, from whom the art was learnt.  Arabic paper"
49,8550,manuscripts from the ninth century onward still exist.  The
49,8551,manufacture entered Christendom either through Greece or by the
49,8552,capture of Moorish paper-mills during the Christian reconquest of
49,8553,Spain.  But under the Christian Spanish the product deteriorated
49,8554,sadly.  Good paper was not made in Christian Europe until the end
49,8555,"of the thirteenth century, and then it was Italy which led the"
49,8556,world.  Only by the fourteenth century did the manufacture reach
49,8557,"Germany, and not until the end of that century was it abundant and"
49,8558,{298} cheap enough for the printing of books to be a practicable
49,8559,business proposition.  Thereupon printing followed naturally and
49,8560,"necessarily, for printing is the most obvious of inventions, and"
49,8561,the intellectual life of the world entered upon a new and far more
49,8562,vigorous phase.  It ceased to be a little trickle from mind to
49,8563,"mind; it became a broad flood, in which thousands and presently"
49,8564,scores and hundreds of thousands of minds participated.
49,8566,One immediate result of this achievement of printing was the
49,8567,appearance of an abundance of Bibles in the world.  Another was a
49,8568,cheapening of school-books.  The knowledge of reading spread
49,8569,swiftly.  There was not only a great increase of books in the
49,8570,"world, but the books that were now made were plainer to read and"
49,8571,so easier to understand.  Instead of toiling at a crabbed text
49,8572,"arid then thinking over its significance, readers now could think"
49,8573,unimpeded as they read.  With this increase in the facility of
49,8574,"reading, the reading public grew.  The book ceased to be a highly"
49,8575,decorated toy or a scholar's mystery.  People began to write books
49,8576,to be read as well as looked at by ordinary people.  They wrote in
49,8577,the ordinary language and not in Latin.  With the fourteenth
49,8578,century the real history of the European literature begins.
49,8580,So far we have been dealing only with the Saracenic share in the
49,8581,European revival.  Let us turn now to the influence of the Mongol
49,8582,conquests.  They stimulated the geographical imagination of Europe
49,8583,"enormously.  For a time under the Great Khan, all Asia and Western"
49,8584,Europe enjoyed an open intercourse; all the roads were temporarily
49,8585,"open, and representatives of every nation appeared at the court of"
49,8586,Karakorum.  The barriers between Europe and Asia set up by the
49,8587,religious feud of Christianity and Islam were lowered.  Great
49,8588,hopes were entertained by the papacy for the conversion of the
49,8589,Mongols to Christianity.  Their only religion so far had been
49,8590,"Shumanism, a primitive paganism.  Envoys of the Pope, Buddhist"
49,8591,"priests from India, Parisian and Italian and Chinese artificers,"
49,8592,"Byzantine and Armenian merchants, mingled with Arab officials and"
49,8593,Persian and Indian astronomers and mathematicians at the Mongol
49,8594,court.  We hear too much in history of the campaigns and massacres
49,8595,"of the Mongols, and not enough of their curiosity and desire for"
49,8596,"learning.  Not perhaps as an originative people, but as"
49,8597,transmitters {299} of knowledge and method their influence upon
49,8598,the world's history has been very great.  And everything one can
49,8599,learn of the vague and romantic personalities of Jengis or Kublai
49,8600,tends to confirm the impression that these men were at least as
49,8601,understanding and creative monarchs as either that flamboyant but
49,8602,egotistical figure Alexander the Great or that raiser of political
49,8603,"ghosts, that energetic but illiterate theologian Charlemagne."
49,8607,One of the most interesting of these visitors to the Mongol Court
49,8608,"was a certain Venetian, Marco Polo, who afterwards set down his"
49,8609,story in a book.  He went to China about 1272 with his father and
49,8610,"uncle, who had already once made the journey.  The Great Khan had"
49,8611,been deeply impressed by the elder Polos; they were the first men
49,8612,"of the ""Latin"" peoples he had seen; and he sent them back with"
49,8613,enquiries for teachers and learned men who could explain
49,8614,"Christianity to him, and for various other European things that"
49,8615,had aroused his curiosity.  Their visit with Marco was their
49,8616,second visit.
49,8618,"The three Polos started by way of Palestine and not by the Crimea,"
49,8619,as in their previous expedition.  They had with them a gold tablet
49,8620,and other indications from the Great Khan that must have greatly
49,8621,facilitated their journey.  The Great Khan had asked for some oil
49,8622,from the lamp that burns in the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem; and
49,8623,"so thither they first went, and then by way of Cilicia into"
49,8624,Armenia.  They went thus far north because the Sultan of Egypt was
49,8625,raiding the Mongol domains at this time.  Thence they came by way
49,8626,"of Mesopotamia to Ormuz on the Persian Gulf, as if they"
49,8627,contemplated a sea voyage.  At Ormuz they met merchants from
49,8628,"India.  For some reason they did not take ship, but instead turned"
49,8629,"northward through the Persian deserts, and so by way of Balkh over"
49,8630,"{300} the Pamir to Kashgar, and by way of Kotan and the Lob Nor"
49,8631,into the Hwang-ho valley and on to Pekin.  At Pekin was the Great
49,8632,"Khan, and they were hospitably entertained."
49,8636,"Marco particularly pleased Kublai; he was young and clever, and it"
49,8637,is clear he had mastered the Tartar language very thoroughly.  He
49,8638,"was given an official position and sent on several missions,"
49,8639,chiefly in south-west China.  The tale he had to tell of vast
49,8640,"stretches of smiling and prosperous country, ""all the way"
49,8641,"excellent hostelries for travellers,"" and ""fine vineyards, fields,"
49,8642,"and gardens,"" of ""many abbeys"" of Buddhist monks, of manufactures"
49,8643,"of ""cloth of silk and gold and many fine taffetas,"" a ""constant"
49,8644,"succession of cities and boroughs,"" and so on, first roused the"
49,8645,incredulity and then fired the imagination of all Europe.  He told
49,8646,"of Burmah, and of its great armies with hundreds of elephants, and"
49,8647,"how these animals were defeated by the Mongol bowmen, and also of"
49,8648,"the Mongol conquest of Pegu.  He told of Japan, and greatly"
49,8649,exaggerated the amount of gold in that country.  For three years
49,8650,"Marco ruled the city of Yang-chow as governor, and he probably"
49,8651,impressed the Chinese inhabitants as being little more of a
49,8652,foreigner than any Tartar would have been.  He may also have been
49,8653,sent on a mission to India.  Chinese records mention a certain
49,8654,"Polo attached to the imperial council in 1277, a very valuable"
49,8655,confirmation of the general truth of the Polo story.
49,8657,The publication of Marco Polo's travels produced a profound effect
49,8658,"upon the European imagination.  The European literature, and"
49,8659,"especially the European romance of the fifteenth century, echoes"
49,8660,"with the names in Marco Polo's story, with Cathay (North China)"
49,8661,and Cambulac (Pekin) and the like.
49,8665,"Two centuries later, among the readers of the Travels of Marco"
49,8666,"Polo was a certain Genoese mariner, Christopher Columbus, who"
49,8667,{301} conceived the brilliant idea of sailing westward round the
49,8668,world to China.  In Seville there is a copy of the Travels with
49,8669,marginal notes by Columbus.  There were many reasons why the
49,8670,thought of a Genoese should be turned in this direction.  Until
49,8671,its capture by the Turks in 1453 Constantinople had been an
49,8672,"impartial trading mart between the Western world and the East, and"
49,8673,"the Genoese had traded there freely.  But the ""Latin"" Venetians,"
49,8674,"the bitter rivals of the Genoese, had been the allies and helpers"
49,8675,"of the Turks against the Greeks, and with the coming of the Turks"
49,8676,Constantinople turned an {302} unfriendly face upon Genoese trade.
49,8677,The long forgotten discovery that the world was round had
49,8678,gradually resumed its sway over men's minds.  The idea of going
49,8679,westward to China was therefore a fairly obvious one.  It was
49,8680,encouraged by two things.  The mariner's compass had now been
49,8681,invented and men were no longer left to the mercy of a fine night
49,8682,and the stars to determine the direction in which they were
49,8683,"sailing, and the Normans, Catalonians and Genoese and Portuguese"
49,8684,had already pushed out into the Atlantic as far as the Canary
49,8685,"Isles, Madeira and the Azores."
49,8687,Yet Columbus found many difficulties before he could get ships to
49,8688,put his idea to the test.  He went from one European Court to
49,8689,"another.  Finally at Granada, just won from the Moors, he secured"
49,8690,"the patronage of Ferdinand and Isabella, and was able to set out"
49,8691,across the unknown ocean in three small ships.  After a voyage of
49,8692,two months and nine days he came to a land which he believed to be
49,8693,"India, but which was really a new continent, whose distinct"
49,8694,existence the old world had never hitherto suspected.  He returned
49,8695,"to Spain with gold, cotton, strange beasts and birds, and two"
49,8696,wild-eyed painted Indians to be baptized.  They were called
49,8697,"Indians because, to the end of his days, he believed that this"
49,8698,land he had found was India.  Only in the course of several years
49,8699,did men begin to realize that the whole new continent of America
49,8700,was added to the world's resources.
49,8702,The success of Columbus stimulated overseas enterprise enormously.
49,8703,"In 1497 the Portuguese sailed round Africa to India, and in 1515"
49,8704,"there were Portuguese ships in Java.  In 1519 Magellan, a"
49,8705,"Portuguese sailor in Spanish employment, sailed out of Seville"
49,8706,"westward with five ships, of which one, the _Vittoria_, came back"
49,8707,"up the river to Seville in 1522, the first ship that had ever"
49,8708,"circumnavigated the world.  Thirty-one men were aboard her,"
49,8709,survivors of two-hundred-and-eighty who had started.  Magellan
49,8710,himself had been killed in the Philippine Isles.
49,8712,"Printed paper books, a new realization of the round world as a"
49,8713,"thing altogether attainable, a new vision of strange lands,"
49,8714,"strange animals and plants, strange manners and customs,"
49,8715,discoveries overseas and in the skies and in the ways and
49,8716,materials of life burst upon the European mind. The Greek
49,8717,"classics, buried and forgotten for so {303} long, were speedily"
49,8718,"being printed and studied, and were colouring men's thoughts with"
49,8719,the dreams of Plato and the traditions of an age of republican
49,8720,freedom and dignity.  The Roman dominion had first brought law and
49,8721,"order to Western Europe, and the Latin Church had restored it; but"
49,8722,under both Pagan and Catholic Rome curiosity and innovation were
49,8723,subordinate to and restrained by organization.  The reign of the
49,8724,Latin mind was now drawing to an end.  Between the thirteenth and
49,8725,"the sixteenth century the European Aryans, thanks to the"
49,8726,stimulating influence of Semite and Mongol and the rediscovery of
49,8727,"the Greek classics, broke away from the Latin tradition and rose"
49,8728,again to the intellectual and material leadership of mankind.
50,8740,The Latin Church itself was enormously affected by this mental
50,8741,rebirth.  It was dismembered; and even the portion that survived
50,8742,was extensively renewed.
50,8744,We have told how nearly the church came to the autocratic
50,8745,leadership of all Christendom in the eleventh and twelfth
50,8746,"centuries, and how in the fourteenth and fifteenth its power over"
50,8747,men's minds and affairs declined.  We have described how popular
50,8748,religious enthusiasm which had in earlier ages been its support
50,8749,"and power was turned against it by its pride, persecutions and"
50,8750,"centralization, and how the insidious scepticism of Frederick II"
50,8751,bore fruit in a growing insubordination of the princes.  The Great
50,8752,Schism had reduced its religious and political prestige to
50,8753,negligible proportions.  The forces of insurrection struck it now
50,8754,from both sides.
50,8756,The teachings of the Englishman Wycliffe spread widely throughout
50,8757,"Europe.  In 1398 a learned Czech, John Huss, delivered a series of"
50,8758,lectures upon Wycliffe's teachings in the university of Prague.
50,8759,This teaching spread rapidly beyond the educated class and aroused
50,8760,great popular enthusiasm.  In 1414-18 a Council of the whole
50,8761,church was held at Constance to settle the Great Schism.  Huss was
50,8762,invited to this Council under promise of a safe conduct from the
50,8763,"emperor, seized, put on trial for heresy and burnt alive (1415)."
50,8764,"So far from tranquillizing the Bohemian people, this led to an"
50,8765,"insurrection of the Hussites in that country, the first of a"
50,8766,series of religious wars that inaugurated the break-up of Latin
50,8767,"Christendom.  Against this insurrection Pope Martin V, the Pope"
50,8768,specially elected at Constance as the head of a reunited
50,8769,"Christendom, preached a Crusade."
50,8771,Five Crusades in all were launched upon this sturdy little people
50,8772,and all of them failed.  All the unemployed ruffianism of Europe
50,8773,"was {305} turned upon Bohemia in the fifteenth century, just as in"
50,8774,the thirteenth it had been turned upon the Waldenses.  But the
50,8775,"Bohemian Czechs, unlike the Waldenses, believed in armed"
50,8776,resistance.  The Bohemian Crusade dissolved and streamed away from
50,8777,the battlefield at the sound of the Hussites' waggons and the
50,8778,distant chanting of their troops; it did not even wait to fight
50,8779,"(battle of Domazlice, 1431).  In 1436 an agreement was patched up"
50,8780,with the Hussites by a new Council of the church at Basle in which
50,8781,many of the special objections to Latin practice were conceded.
50,8785,In the fifteenth century a great pestilence had produced much
50,8786,social disorganization throughout Europe.  There had been extreme
50,8787,"misery and discontent among the common people, and peasant risings"
50,8788,against the landlords and the wealthy in England and France.
50,8789,After the Hussite Wars these peasant insurrections increased in
50,8790,gravity in Germany and took on a religious character.  Printing
50,8791,came in as an influence upon this development.  By the middle of
50,8792,the fifteenth century there were printers at work with movable
50,8793,type {306} in Holland and the Rhineland.  The art spread to Italy
50,8794,"and England, where Caxton was printing in Westminster in 1477."
50,8795,The immediate consequence was a great increase and distribution of
50,8796,"Bibles, and greatly increased facilities for widespread popular"
50,8797,"controversies.  The European world became a world of readers, to"
50,8798,an extent that had never happened to any community in the past.
50,8799,And this sudden irrigation of the general mind with clearer ideas
50,8800,and more accessible information occurred just at a time when the
50,8801,church was confused and divided and not in a position to defend
50,8802,"itself effectively, and when many princes were looking for means"
50,8803,to weaken its hold upon the vast wealth it claimed in their
50,8804,dominions.
50,8806,In Germany the attack upon the church gathered round the
50,8807,"personality of an ex-monk, Martin Luther (1483-1546), who appeared"
50,8808,in Wittenberg in 1517 offering disputations against various
50,8809,orthodox doctrines and practices.  At first he disputed in Latin
50,8810,in the fashion of the Schoolmen.  Then he took up the new weapon
50,8811,of the printed word and scattered his views far and wide in German
50,8812,addressed to the ordinary people.  An attempt was made to suppress
50,8813,"him as Huss had been suppressed, but the printing press had"
50,8814,changed conditions and he had too many open and secret friends
50,8815,among the German princes for this fate to overtake him.
50,8817,For now in this age of multiplying ideas and weakened faith there
50,8818,were many rulers who saw their advantage in breaking the religious
50,8819,ties between their people and Rome.  They sought to make
50,8820,themselves in person the heads of a more nationalized religion.
50,8821,"England, Scotland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, North Germany and"
50,8822,"Bohemia, one after another, separated themselves from the Roman"
50,8823,Communion.  They have remained separated ever since.
50,8825,The various princes concerned cared very little for the moral and
50,8826,intellectual freedom of their subjects.  They used the religious
50,8827,doubts and insurgence of their peoples to strengthen them against
50,8828,"Rome, but they tried to keep a grip upon the popular movement as"
50,8829,soon as that rupture was achieved and a national church set up
50,8830,under the control of the crown.  But there has always been a
50,8831,"curious vitality in the teaching of Jesus, a direct appeal to"
50,8832,righteousness and a man's self-respect over every loyalty and
50,8833,"every subordination, lay or ecclesiastical.  None of these"
50,8834,princely churches broke {307} off without also breaking off a
50,8835,number of fragmentary sects that would admit the intervention of
50,8836,neither prince nor Pope between a man and his God.  In England and
50,8837,"Scotland, for example, there was a number of sects who now held"
50,8838,firmly to the Bible as their one guide in life and belief.  They
50,8839,refused the disciplines of a state church.  In England these
50,8840,"dissentients were the Non-conformists, who played a very large"
50,8841,part in the polities of that country in the seventeenth {308} and
50,8842,eighteenth centuries.  In England they carried their objection to
50,8843,a princely head to the church so far as to decapitate King Charles
50,8844,"I (1649), and for eleven prosperous years England was a republic"
50,8845,under Non-conformist rule.
50,8849,The breaking away of this large section of Northern Europe from
50,8850,Latin Christendom is what is generally spoken of as the
50,8851,Reformation.  But the shock and stress of these losses produced
50,8852,changes perhaps as profound in the Roman Church itself.  The
50,8853,church was reorganized and a new spirit came into its life.  One
50,8854,of the dominant figures in this revival was a young Spanish
50,8855,"soldier, Inigo Lopez de Recalde, better known to the world as St."
50,8856,Ignatius of Loyola.  After some romantic beginnings he became a
50,8857,"priest (1538) and was permitted to found the Society of Jesus, a"
50,8858,direct attempt to bring the generous and chivalrous traditions of
50,8859,military discipline into the service of religion.  This Society of
50,8860,"Jesus, the Jesuits, became one of the greatest teaching and"
50,8861,missionary societies the world has ever seen.  It carried
50,8862,"Christianity to India, China and America.  It arrested the rapid"
50,8863,disintegration of the Roman Church.  It raised the standard of
50,8864,education throughout the whole Catholic world; it raised the level
50,8865,of Catholic intelligence and quickened the Catholic conscience
50,8866,everywhere; it stimulated Protestant Europe to competitive
50,8867,educational efforts.  The vigorous and aggressive Roman Catholic
50,8868,Church we know to-day is largely the product of this Jesuit
50,8869,revival.
51,8881,The Holy Roman Empire came to a sort of climax in the reign of the
51,8882,Emperor Charles V.  He was one of the most extraordinary monarchs
51,8883,that Europe has ever seen.  For a time he had the air of being the
51,8884,greatest monarch since Charlemagne.
51,8886,His greatness was not of his own making.  It was largely the
51,8887,"creation of his grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian I"
51,8888,"(1459-1519).  Some families have fought, others have intrigued"
51,8889,their way to world power; the Habsburgs married their way.
51,8890,"Maximilian began his career with Austria, Styria, part of Alsace"
51,8891,"and other districts, the original Habsburg patrimony; he"
51,8892,married--the lady's name scarcely matters to us--the Netherlands
51,8893,and Burgundy.  Most of Burgundy slipped from him after his first
51,8894,"wife's death, but the Netherlands he held.  Then he tried"
51,8895,unsuccessfully to marry Brittany.  He became Emperor in succession
51,8896,"to his father, Frederick III, in 1493, and married the duchy of"
51,8897,Milan.  Finally he married his son to the weak-minded daughter of
51,8898,"Ferdinand and Isabella, the Ferdinand and Isabella of Columbus,"
51,8899,who not only reigned over a freshly united Spain and over Sardinia
51,8900,"and the kingdom of the two Sicilies, but over all America west of"
51,8901,"Brazil.  So it was that this Charles V, his grandson, inherited"
51,8902,most of the American continent and between a third and a half of
51,8903,what the Turks had left of Europe.  He succeeded to the
51,8904,"Netherlands in 1506.  When his grandfather Ferdinand died in 1516,"
51,8905,"he became practically king of the Spanish dominions, his mother"
51,8906,"being imbecile; and his grandfather Maximilian dying in 1519, he"
51,8907,was in 1520 elected Emperor at the still comparatively tender age
51,8908,of twenty.
51,8910,"He was a fair young man with a not very intelligent face, a thick"
51,8911,upper lip and a long clumsy chin.  He found himself in a world of
51,8912,young and vigorous personalities.  It was an age of brilliant
51,8913,young {310} monarchs.  Francis I had succeeded to the French
51,8914,"throne in 1515 at the age of twenty-one, Henry VIII had become"
51,8915,King of England in 1509 at eighteen.  It was the age of Baber in
51,8916,"India (1526-1530) and Suleiman the Magnificent in Turkey (1520),"
51,8917,"both exceptionally capable monarchs, and the Pope Leo X (1513) was"
51,8918,also a very distinguished Pope.  The Pope and Francis I attempted
51,8919,to prevent the election of Charles as Emperor because they dreaded
51,8920,the concentration of so much power in the hands of one man.  Both
51,8921,Francis I and Henry VIII offered themselves to the imperial
51,8922,electors.  But there was now a long established tradition of
51,8923,"Habsburg Emperors (since 1273), and some energetic bribery secured"
51,8924,the election for Charles.
51,8926,At first the young man was very much a magnificent puppet in the
51,8927,hands of his ministers.  Then slowly he began to assert himself
51,8928,and take control.  He began to realize something of the
51,8929,threatening complexities of his exalted position.  It was a
51,8930,position as unsound as it was splendid.
51,8932,From the very outset of his reign he was faced by the situation
51,8933,created by Luther's agitations in Germany.  The Emperor had one
51,8934,reason for siding with the reformers in the opposition of the Pope
51,8935,"to his election.  But he had been brought up in Spain, that most"
51,8936,"Catholic of countries, and he decided against Luther.  So he came"
51,8937,into conflict with the Protestant princes and particularly the
51,8938,Elector of Saxony.  He found himself in the presence of an opening
51,8939,rift that was to split the outworn fabric of Christendom into two
51,8940,contending camps.  His attempts to close that rift were strenuous
51,8941,and honest and ineffective.  There was an extensive peasant revolt
51,8942,in Germany which interwove with the general political and
51,8943,religious disturbance.  And these internal troubles were
51,8944,complicated by attacks upon the Empire from east and west alike.
51,8945,"On the west of Charles was his spirited rival, Francis I; to the"
51,8946,"east was the ever advancing Turk, who was now in Hungary, in"
51,8947,alliance with Francis and clamouring for certain arrears of
51,8948,tribute from the Austrian dominions.  Charles had the money and
51,8949,"army of Spain at his disposal, but it was extremely difficult to"
51,8950,get any effective support in money from Germany.  His social and
51,8951,political troubles were complicated by financial distresses.  He
51,8952,was forced to ruinous borrowing.
51,8960,"On the whole, Charles, in alliance with Henry VIII, was successful"
51,8961,against Francis I and the Turk.  Their chief battlefield was North
51,8962,Italy; the generalship was dull on both sides; their advances and
51,8963,retreats depended mainly on the arrival of reinforcements.  The
51,8964,"German army invaded France, failed to take Marseilles, fell back"
51,8965,"into Italy, lost Milan, and was besieged in Pavia.  Francis I made"
51,8966,"a long and unsuccessful siege of Pavia, was caught by fresh German"
51,8967,"forces, defeated, wounded and taken prisoner.  But thereupon the"
51,8968,"Pope and Henry VIII, still haunted by the fear of his attaining"
51,8969,"excessive power, turned against Charles.  The German troops in"
51,8970,"Milan, under the Constable of Bourbon, being unpaid, forced rather"
51,8971,than followed their commander into a raid upon Rome.  They stormed
51,8972,the city and pillaged it (1527).  The Pope took refuge in the
51,8973,Castle of St. Angelo while the looting and slaughter went on.  He
51,8974,bought off the German troops at last by the payment of four
51,8975,hundred thousand ducats.  Ten years of such confused fighting
51,8976,impoverished all Europe.  At last the Emperor found himself
51,8977,"triumphant in Italy.  In 1530, he was crowned by the Pope--he was"
51,8978,the last German Emperor to be so crowned--at Bologna.
51,8980,Meanwhile the Turks were making great headway in Hungary.  They
51,8981,"had defeated and killed the king of Hungary in 1526, they held"
51,8982,"Buda-Pesth, and in 1529 Suleiman the Magnificent very nearly took"
51,8983,"Vienna.  The Emperor was greatly concerned by these advances, and"
51,8984,"did his utmost to drive back the Turks, but he found the greatest"
51,8985,difficulty in getting the German princes to unite even with this
51,8986,formidable enemy upon their very borders.  Francis I remained
51,8987,"implacable for a time, and there was a new French war; but in 1538"
51,8988,Charles won his rival over to a more friendly attitude after
51,8989,ravaging the south of France.  Francis and Charles then formed an
51,8990,"alliance against the Turk.  But the Protestant princes, the German"
51,8991,"princes who were resolved to break away from Rome, had formed a"
51,8992,"league, the Schmalkaldic League, against the Emperor, and in the"
51,8993,place of a great campaign to recover Hungary for Christendom
51,8994,Charles had to turn his mind to the gathering internal struggle in
51,8995,Germany.  Of that struggle he saw only the opening war.  It was a
51,8996,"struggle, a sanguinary irrational bickering of princes, for"
51,8997,"ascendancy, now {313} flaming into war and destruction, now"
51,8998,sinking back to intrigues and diplomacies; it was a snake's sack
51,8999,of princely policies that was to go on writhing incurably right
51,9000,into the nineteenth century and to waste and desolate Central
51,9001,Europe again and again.
51,9003,The Emperor never seems to have grasped the true forces at work in
51,9004,these gathering troubles.  He was for his time and station an
51,9005,"exceptionally worthy man, and he seems to have taken the religious"
51,9006,dissensions that were tearing Europe into warring fragments as
51,9007,genuine theological differences.  He gathered diets and councils
51,9008,in futile attempts at reconciliation.  Formulae and confessions
51,9009,were tried over.  The student of German history must struggle with
51,9010,"the details of the Religious Peace of Nuremberg, the settlement at"
51,9011,"the Diet of Ratisbon, the Interim of Augsburg, and the like.  Here"
51,9012,we do but mention them as details in the worried life of this
51,9013,"culminating Emperor.  As a matter of fact, hardly one of the"
51,9014,multifarious princes and rulers in Europe seems to have been
51,9015,acting in good faith.  The widespread religious trouble of the
51,9016,"world, the desire of the common people for truth and social"
51,9017,"righteousness, the spreading knowledge of the time, all those"
51,9018,things were merely counters in the imaginations of princely
51,9019,"diplomacy.  Henry VIII of England, who had begun his career with a"
51,9020,"book against heresy, and who had been rewarded by the Pope with"
51,9021,"the title of ""Defender of the Faith,"" being anxious to divorce his"
51,9022,"first wife in favour of a young lady named Anne Boleyn, and"
51,9023,"wishing also to loot the vast wealth of the church in England,"
51,9024,"joined the company of Protestant princes in 1530.  Sweden, Denmark"
51,9025,and Norway had already gone over to the Protestant side.
51,9027,"The German religious war began in 1546, a few months after the"
51,9028,death of Martin Luther.  We need not trouble about the incidents
51,9029,of the campaign.  The Protestant Saxon army was badly beaten at
51,9030,"Lochau.  By something very like a breach of faith Philip of Hesse,"
51,9031,"the Emperor's chief remaining antagonist, was caught and"
51,9032,"imprisoned, and the Turks were bought off by the promise of an"
51,9033,"annual tribute.  In 1547, to the great relief of the Emperor,"
51,9034,"Francis I died.  So by 1547 Charles got to a kind of settlement,"
51,9035,and made his last efforts to effect peace where there was no
51,9036,"peace.  In 1552 all Germany was at war again, only a precipitate"
51,9037,"flight from Innsbruck {314} saved Charles from capture, and in"
51,9038,"1552, with the treaty of Passau, came another unstable"
51,9039,equilibrium....
51,9041,Such is the brief outline of the politics of the Empire for
51,9042,thirty-two years.  It is interesting to note how entirely the
51,9043,European mind was concentrated upon the struggle for European
51,9044,"ascendancy.  Neither Turks, French, English nor Germans had yet"
51,9045,discovered any political interest in the great continent of
51,9046,"America, nor any significance in the new sea routes to Asia."
51,9047,Great things were happening in America; Cortez with a mere handful
51,9048,of men had conquered the great Neolithic empire of Mexico for
51,9049,"Spain, Pizarro had crossed the Isthmus of Panama (1530) and"
51,9050,"subjugated another wonder-land, Peru.  But as yet these events"
51,9051,meant no more to Europe than a useful and stimulating influx of
51,9052,silver to the Spanish treasury.
51,9054,It was after the treaty of Passau that Charles began to display
51,9055,his distinctive originality of mind.  He was now entirely bored
51,9056,and disillusioned by his imperial greatness.  A sense of the
51,9057,intolerable futility of these European rivalries came upon him.
51,9058,"He had never been of a very sound constitution, he was naturally"
51,9059,indolent and he was suffering greatly from gout.  He abdicated.
51,9060,He made over all his sovereign rights in Germany to his brother
51,9061,"Ferdinand, and Spain and the Netherlands he resigned to his son"
51,9062,Philip.  Then in a sort of magnificent dudgeon he retired to a
51,9063,"monastery at Yuste, among the oak and chestnut forests in the"
51,9064,hills to the north of the Tagus valley.  There he died in 1558.
51,9066,"Much has been written in a sentimental vein of this retirement,"
51,9067,"this renunciation of the world by this tired majestic Titan,"
51,9068,"world-weary, seeking in an austere solitude his peace with God."
51,9069,But his retreat was neither solitary nor austere; he had with him
51,9070,nearly a hundred and fifty attendants: his establishment had all
51,9071,"the splendour and indulgences without the fatigues or a court, and"
51,9072,Philip II was a dutiful son to whom his father's advice was a
51,9073,command.
51,9078,And if Charles had lost his living interest in the administration
51,9079,"of European affairs, there were other motives of a more immediate"
51,9080,"sort to stir him.  Says Prescott: ""In the almost daily"
51,9081,"correspondence between Quixada, or Gaztelu, and the Secretary of"
51,9082,"State at Valladolid, there is scarcely a letter that does not turn"
51,9083,more or less on the Emperor's eating or his illness.  The one
51,9084,"seems naturally to follow, {315} like a running commentary, on the"
51,9085,other.  It is rare that such topics have formed the burden of
51,9086,communications with the department of state.  It must have been no
51,9087,easy matter for the secretary to preserve his gravity in the
51,9088,perusal of despatches in which politics and gastronomy were so
51,9089,strangely mixed together.  The courier from Valladolid to Lisbon
51,9090,"was ordered to make a detour, so as to take Jarandilla in his"
51,9091,"route, and bring supplies to the royal table.  On {316} Thursdays"
51,9092,he was to bring fish to serve for the _jour maigre_ that was to
51,9093,"follow.  The trout in the neighbourhood Charles thought too small,"
51,9094,so others of a larger size were to be sent from Valladolid.  Fish
51,9095,"of every kind was to his taste, as, indeed, was anything that in"
51,9096,"its nature or habits at all approached to fish.  Eels, frogs,"
51,9097,"oysters, occupied an important place in the royal bill of fare."
51,9098,"Potted fish, especially anchovies, found great favour with him;"
51,9099,and he regretted that he had not brought a better supply of these
51,9100,from the Low Countries.  On an eel-pasty he particularly
51,9101,"doted."" ...  [6]"
51,9103,In 1554 Charles had obtained a bull from Pope Julius III granting
51,9104,"him a dispensation from fasting, and allowing him to break his"
51,9105,fast early in the morning even when he was to take the sacrament.
51,9107,Eating and doctoring! it was a return to elemental things.  He had
51,9108,"never acquired the habit of reading, but he would be read aloud to"
51,9109,"at meals after the fashion of Charlemagne, and would make what one"
51,9110,"narrator describes as a ""sweet and heavenly commentary.""  He also"
51,9111,"amused himself with mechanical toys, by listening to music or"
51,9112,"sermons, and by attending to the imperial business that still came"
51,9113,"drifting in to him.  The death of the Empress, to whom he was"
51,9114,"greatly attached, had turned his mind towards religion, which in"
51,9115,his case took a punctilious and ceremonial form; every Friday in
51,9116,Lent he scourged himself with the rest of the monks with such good
51,9117,will as to draw blood.  These exercises and the gout released a
51,9118,bigotry in Charles that had hitherto been restrained by
51,9119,considerations of policy.  The appearance of Protestant teaching
51,9120,"close at hand in Valladolid roused him to fury.  ""Tell the grand"
51,9121,"inquisitor and his council from me to be at their posts, and to"
51,9122,lay the axe at the root of the evil before it spreads
51,9123,"further."" .... He expressed a doubt whether it would not be well,"
51,9124,"in so black an affair, to dispense with the ordinary course of"
51,9125,"justice, and to show no mercy; ""lest the criminal, if pardoned,"
51,9126,"should have the opportunity of repeating his crime.""  He"
51,9127,"recommended, as an example, his own mode or proceeding in the"
51,9128,"Netherlands, ""where all who remained obstinate in their errors"
51,9129,"were burned alive, and those who were admitted to penitence"
51,9130,"were beheaded."""
51,9132,And almost symbolical of his place and role in history was his
51,9133,{317} preoccupation with funerals.  He seems to have had an
51,9134,intuition that something great was dead in Europe and sorely
51,9135,"needed burial, that there was a need to write Finis, overdue.  He"
51,9136,not only attended every actual funeral that was celebrated at
51,9137,"Yuste, but he had services conducted for the absent dead, he held"
51,9138,a funeral service in memory of his wife on the anniversary of her
51,9139,"death, and finally he celebrated his own obsequies."
51,9141,"""The chapel was hung with black, and the blaze of hundreds of"
51,9142,wax-lights was scarcely sufficient to dispel the darkness.  The
51,9143,"brethren in their conventual dress, and all the Emperor's"
51,9144,"household clad in deep mourning, gathered round a huge catafalque,"
51,9145,"shrouded also in black, which had been raised in the centre of the"
51,9146,chapel.  The service for the burial of the dead was then
51,9147,"performed; and, amidst the dismal wail of the monks, the prayers"
51,9148,"ascended for the departed spirit, that it might be received into"
51,9149,the mansions of the blessed.  The sorrowful attendants were melted
51,9150,"to tears, as the image of their master's death was presented to"
51,9151,"their minds--or they were touched, it may be, with compassion by"
51,9152,"this pitiable display of weakness.  Charles, muffled in a dark"
51,9153,"mantle, and bearing a lighted candle in his hand, mingled with his"
51,9154,"household, the spectator of his own obsequies; and the doleful"
51,9155,ceremony was concluded by his placing the taper in the hands of
51,9156,"the priest, in sign of his surrendering up his soul to the"
51,9157,"Almighty."""
51,9159,Within two months of this masquerade he was dead.  And the brief
51,9160,greatness of the Holy Roman Empire died with him.  His realm was
51,9161,already divided between his brother and his son.  The Holy Roman
51,9162,Empire struggled on indeed to the days of Napoleon I but as an
51,9163,invalid and dying thing.  To this day its unburied tradition still
51,9164,poisons the political air.
52,9179,"The Latin Church was broken, the Holy Roman Empire was in extreme"
52,9180,decay; the history of Europe from the opening of the sixteenth
52,9181,century onward is a story of peoples feeling their way darkly to
52,9182,"some new method of government, better adapted to the new"
52,9183,"conditions that were arising.  In the Ancient World, over long"
52,9184,"periods of time, there had been changes of dynasty and even"
52,9185,"changes of ruling race and language, but the form of government"
52,9186,"through monarch and temple remained fairly stable, and still more"
52,9187,stable was the ordinary way of living.  In this modern Europe
52,9188,"since the sixteenth century the dynastic changes are unimportant,"
52,9189,and the interest of history lies in the wide and increasing
52,9190,variety of experiments in political and social organization.
52,9192,The political history of the world from the sixteenth century
52,9193,"onward was, we have said, an effort, a largely unconscious effort,"
52,9194,of mankind to adapt its political and social methods to certain
52,9195,new conditions that had now arisen.  The effort to adapt was
52,9196,complicated by the fad that the conditions themselves were
52,9197,"changing with a steadily increasing rapidity.  The adaptation,"
52,9198,mainly unconscious and almost always unwilling (for man in general
52,9199,"hates voluntary change), has lagged more and more behind the"
52,9200,alterations in conditions.  From the sixteenth century onward the
52,9201,history of mankind is a story of political and social institutions
52,9202,"becoming more and more plainly misfits, less comfortable and more"
52,9203,"vexatious, and of the slow reluctant realization of the need for a"
52,9204,conscious and deliberate reconstruction of the whole scheme of
52,9205,human societies in the face of needs and possibilities new to all
52,9206,the former experiences of life.
52,9208,What are these changes in the conditions of human life that have
52,9209,"disorganized that balance of empire, priest, peasant and trader,"
52,9210,"with {319} periodic refreshment by barbaric conquest, that has"
52,9211,held human affairs in the Old World in a sort of working rhythm
52,9212,for more than a hundred centuries?
52,9214,"They are manifold and various, for human affairs are"
52,9215,multitudinously complex; but the main changes seem all to turn
52,9216,"upon one cause, namely the growth and extension of a knowledge of"
52,9217,"the nature of things, beginning first of all in small groups of"
52,9218,"intelligent people and spreading at first slowly, and in the last"
52,9219,"five hundred years very rapidly, to larger and larger proportions"
52,9220,of the general population.
52,9222,But there has also been a great change in human conditions due to
52,9223,a change in the spirit of human life.  This change has gone on
52,9224,"side by side with the increase and extension of knowledge, and is"
52,9225,subtly connected with it.  There has been an increasing
52,9226,disposition to treat a life based on the common and more
52,9227,"elementary desires and gratifications as unsatisfactory, and to"
52,9228,seek relationship with and service and participation in a larger
52,9229,life.  This is the common characteristic of all the great
52,9230,religions that have spread throughout the world in the last twenty
52,9231,"odd centuries, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam alike.  They have"
52,9232,had to do with the spirit of man in a way that the older religions
52,9233,did not have to do.  They are forces quite different in their
52,9234,nature and effect from the old fetishistic blood-sacrifice
52,9235,religions of priest and temple that they have in part modified and
52,9236,in part replaced.  They have gradually evolved a self-respect in
52,9237,the individual and a sense of participation and responsibility in
52,9238,the common concerns of mankind that did not exist among the
52,9239,populations of the earlier civilizations.
52,9241,The first considerable change in the conditions of political and
52,9242,social life was the simplification and extended use of writing in
52,9243,the ancient civilizations which made larger empires and wider
52,9244,political understandings practicable and inevitable.  The next
52,9245,"movement forward came with the introduction of the horse, and"
52,9246,"later on of the camel as a means of transport, the use of wheeled"
52,9247,"vehicles, the extension of roads and the increased military"
52,9248,efficiency due to the discovery of terrestrial iron.  Then
52,9249,followed the profound economic disturbances due to the device of
52,9250,"coined money and the change in the nature of debt, proprietorship"
52,9251,and trade due to this convenient but dangerous convention.  The
52,9252,"empires grew in size and range, and {320} men's ideas grew"
52,9253,likewise to correspond with these things.  Came the disappearance
52,9254,"of local gods, the age of theocrasia, and the teaching of the"
52,9255,great world religions.  Came also the beginnings of reasoned and
52,9256,"recorded history and geography, the first realization by man of"
52,9257,"his profound ignorance, and the first systematic search for"
52,9258,knowledge.
52,9260,For a time the scientific process which began so brilliantly in
52,9261,Greece and Alexandria was interrupted.  The raids of the Teutonic
52,9262,"barbarians, the westward drive of the Mongolian peoples,"
52,9263,convulsive religious reconstruction and great pestilences put
52,9264,enormous strains upon political and social order.  When
52,9265,civilization emerged again from this phase of conflict and
52,9266,"confusion, slavery was no longer the basis of economic life; and"
52,9267,the first paper-mills were preparing a new medium for collective
52,9268,information and co-operation in printed matter.  Gradually at this
52,9269,"point and that, the search for knowledge, the systematic"
52,9270,"scientific process, was resumed."
52,9272,"And now from the sixteenth century onward, as an inevitable"
52,9273,"by-product of systematic thought, appeared a steadily increasing"
52,9274,series of inventions and devices affecting the intercommunication
52,9275,and interaction of men with one another.  They all tended towards
52,9276,"wider range of action, greater mutual benefits or injuries, and"
52,9277,"increased co-operation, and they came faster and faster.  Men's"
52,9278,"minds had not been prepared for anything of the sort, and until"
52,9279,the great catastrophes at the beginning of the twentieth century
52,9280,"quickened men's minds, the historian has very little to tell of"
52,9281,any intelligently planned attempts to meet the new conditions this
52,9282,increasing flow of inventions was creating.  The history of
52,9283,mankind for the last four centuries is rather like that of an
52,9284,"imprisoned sleeper, stirring clumsily and uneasily while the"
52,9285,"prison that restrains and shelters him catches fire, not waking"
52,9286,but incorporating the crackling and warmth of the fire with
52,9287,"ancient and incongruous dreams, than like that of a man"
52,9288,consciously awake to danger and opportunity.
52,9290,Since history is the story not of individual lives but of
52,9291,"communities, it is inevitable that the inventions that figure most"
52,9292,in the historical record are inventions affecting communications.
52,9293,In the sixteenth century the chief new things that we have to note
52,9294,"are the appearance of printed paper and the sea-worthy,"
52,9295,ocean-going sailing ship using the new device of the mariner's
52,9296,"compass.  The former {321} cheapened, spread, and revolutionized"
52,9297,"teaching, public information and discussion, and the fundamental"
52,9298,operations of political activity.  The latter made the round world
52,9299,one.  But almost equally important was the increased utilization
52,9300,and improvement of guns and gunpowder which the Mongols had first
52,9301,brought westward in the thirteenth century.  This destroyed the
52,9302,practical immunity of barons in their castles and of walled
52,9303,cities.  Guns swept away feudalism.  Constantinople fell to guns.
52,9304,Mexico and Peru fell before the terror of the Spanish guns.
52,9309,The seventeenth century saw the development of systematic
52,9310,"scientific publication, a less conspicuous but ultimately far more"
52,9311,pregnant innovation.  Conspicuous among the leaders in this great
52,9312,forward step was Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) afterwards Lord
52,9313,"{322} Verulam, Lord Chancellor of England.  He was the pupil and"
52,9314,"perhaps the mouthpiece of another Englishman; Dr. Gilbert, the"
52,9315,experimental philosopher of Colchester (1540-1603).  This second
52,9316,"Bacon, like the first, preached observation and experiment, and he"
52,9317,"used the inspiring and fruitful form of a Utopian story, _The New"
52,9318,"Atlantis_, to express his dream of a great service of scientific"
52,9319,research.
52,9321,"Presently arose the Royal Society of London, the Florentine"
52,9322,"Society, and later other national bodies for the encouragement of"
52,9323,research and the publication and exchange of knowledge.  These
52,9324,European scientific societies became fountains not only of
52,9325,countless inventions but also of a destructive criticism of the
52,9326,grotesque theological history of the world that had dominated and
52,9327,crippled human thought for many centuries.
52,9329,Neither the seventeenth nor the eighteenth century witnessed any
52,9330,innovations so immediately revolutionary in human conditions as
52,9331,"printed paper and the ocean-going ship, but there was a steady"
52,9332,accumulation of knowledge and scientific energy that was to bear
52,9333,its full fruits in the nineteenth century.  The exploration and
52,9334,"mapping of the world went on.  Tasmania, Australia, New Zealand"
52,9335,appeared on the map.  In Great Britain in the eighteenth century
52,9336,"coal coke began to be used for metallurgical purposes, leading to"
52,9337,a considerable cheapening of iron and to the possibility of
52,9338,casting and using it in larger pieces than had been possible
52,9339,"before, when it had been smelted with wood charcoal.  Modern"
52,9340,machinery dawned.
52,9342,"Like the trees of the celestial city, science bears bud and flower"
52,9343,and fruit at the same time and continuously.  With the onset of
52,9344,the nineteenth century the real fruition of
52,9345,science--which indeed henceforth may never cease--began.  First
52,9346,"came steam and steel, the railway, the great liner, vast bridges"
52,9347,"and buildings, machinery of almost limitless power, the"
52,9348,possibility of a bountiful satisfaction of every material human
52,9349,"need, and then, still more wonderful, the hidden treasures of"
52,9350,electrical science were opened to men ....
52,9352,We have compared the political and social life of man from the
52,9353,sixteenth century onward to that of a sleeping prisoner who lies
52,9354,and dreams while his prison burns about him.  In the sixteenth
52,9355,century the European mind was still going on with its Latin
52,9356,"Imperial dream, {323} its dream of a Holy Roman Empire, united"
52,9357,under a Catholic Church.  But just as some uncontrollable element
52,9358,in our composition will insist at times upon introducing into our
52,9359,"dreams the most absurd and destructive comments, so thrust into"
52,9360,this dream we find the sleeping face and craving stomach of the
52,9361,"Emperor Charles V, while Henry VIII of England and Luther tear the"
52,9362,unity of Catholicism to shreds.
52,9366,In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the dream turned to
52,9367,personal monarchy.  The history of nearly all Europe during this
52,9368,period tells with variations the story of an attempt to
52,9369,"consolidate a monarchy, to make it absolute and to extend its"
52,9370,"power over weaker adjacent regions, and of the steady resistance,"
52,9371,first of the landowners and then with the increase of foreign
52,9372,"trade and home industry, of the growing trading and moneyed class,"
52,9373,to the exaction and interference of the crown.  There is no
52,9374,universal victory of either side; here it is the King who gets the
52,9375,upper hand while there it is the {324} man of private property who
52,9376,beats the King.  In one case we find a King becoming the sun and
52,9377,"centre of his national world, while just over his borders a sturdy"
52,9378,mercantile class maintains a republic.  So wide a range of
52,9379,"variation shows how entirely experimental, what local accidents,"
52,9380,were all the various governments of this period.
52,9382,A very common figure in these national dramas is the King's
52,9383,"minister, often in the still Catholic countries a prelate, who"
52,9384,"stands behind the King, serves him and dominates him by his"
52,9385,indispensable services.
52,9387,Here in the limits set to us it is impossible to tell these
52,9388,various national dramas in detail.  The trading folk of Holland
52,9389,"went Protestant and republican, and cast off the rule of Philip II"
52,9390,"of Spain, the son of the Emperor Charles V.  In England Henry VIII"
52,9391,"and his minister Wolsey, Queen Elizabeth and her minister"
52,9392,"Burleigh, prepared the foundations of an absolutism that was"
52,9393,wrecked by the folly of James I and Charles I.  Charles I was
52,9394,"beheaded for treason to his people (1649), a new turn in the"
52,9395,political thought of Europe.  For a dozen years (until 1660)
52,9396,"Britain was a republic; and the crown was an unstable power, much"
52,9397,"overshadowed by Parliament, until George III (1760-1820) made a"
52,9398,strenuous and partly successful effort to restore its
52,9399,"predominance.  The King of France, on the other hand, was the most"
52,9400,successful of all the European Kings in perfecting monarchy.  Two
52,9401,"great ministers, Richelieu (1585-1642) and Mazarin"
52,9402,"(1602-1661), built up the power of the crown in that country, and"
52,9403,the process was aided by the long reign and very considerable
52,9404,"abilities of King Louis XIV, ""the Grand Monarque"" (1643-1715)."
52,9406,"Louis XIV was indeed the pattern King of Europe.  He was, within"
52,9407,"his limitations, an exceptionally capable King; his ambition was"
52,9408,"stronger than his baser passions, and he guided his country"
52,9409,towards bankruptcy through the complication of a spirited foreign
52,9410,policy with an elaborate dignity that still extorts our
52,9411,admiration.  His immediate desire was to consolidate and extend
52,9412,"France to the Rhine and Pyrenees, and to absorb the Spanish"
52,9413,Netherlands; his remoter view saw the French Kings as the possible
52,9414,successors of Charlemagne in a recast Holy Roman Empire.  He made
52,9415,bribery a state method almost more important than warfare.
52,9416,"Charles II of {325} England was in his pay, and so were most of"
52,9417,"the Polish nobility, presently to be described.  His money, or"
52,9418,"rather the money of the tax-paying classes in France, went"
52,9419,everywhere.  But his prevailing occupation was splendour.  His
52,9420,"great palace at Versailles with its salons, its corridors, its"
52,9421,"mirrors, its terraces and fountains and parks and prospects, was"
52,9422,the envy and admiration of the world.
52,9426,He provoked a universal imitation.  Every king and princelet in
52,9427,Europe was building his own Versailles as much beyond his means as
52,9428,his subjects and credits would permit.  Everywhere the nobility
52,9429,rebuilt or extended their chateaux to the new pattern.  A great
52,9430,industry of beautiful and elaborate fabrics and furnishings
52,9431,developed.  The luxurious arts flourished everywhere; sculpture in
52,9432,"alabaster, faience, gilt woodwork, metal work, stamped leather,"
52,9433,"much music, magnificent painting, beautiful printing and bindings,"
52,9434,"fine crockery, fine vintages.  Amidst the mirrors and fine"
52,9435,"furniture went a strange race of ""gentlemen"" in tall powdered"
52,9436,"wigs, silks and laces, poised upon high red heels, supported by"
52,9437,"amazing canes; and still more wonderful ""ladies,"" under towers of"
52,9438,powdered hair and wearing vast expansions of silk and satin
52,9439,"sustained on wire.  Through it all postured the great Louis, the"
52,9440,"sun of his world, unaware of the meagre and sulky and bitter faces"
52,9441,that watched him from those lower darknesses to which his sunshine
52,9442,did not penetrate.
52,9446,The German people remained politically divided throughout this
52,9447,"period of the monarchies and experimental governments, and a"
52,9448,considerable {326} number of ducal and princely courts aped the
52,9449,splendours of Versailles on varying scales.  The Thirty Years' War
52,9450,"(1618-48), a devastating scramble among the Germans, Swedes and"
52,9451,"Bohemians for fluctuating political advantages, sapped the"
52,9452,energies of Germany for a century.  A map must show the crazy
52,9453,"patchwork in which this struggle ended, a map of Europe according"
52,9454,to the peace of Westphalia (1648).  One sees a tangle of
52,9455,"principalities, dukedoms, free states and the like, some partly in"
52,9456,"and partly out of the Empire.  Sweden's arm, the reader will note,"
52,9457,reached far into Germany; and except for a few islands of
52,9458,territory within the imperial boundaries France was still far from
52,9459,the Rhine.  Amidst this patchwork the {327} Kingdom of Prussia--it
52,9460,became a Kingdom in 1701--rose steadily to prominence and
52,9461,sustained a series of successful wars.  Frederick the Great of
52,9462,"Prussia (1740-86) had his Versailles at Potsdam, where his court"
52,9463,"spoke French, read French literature and rivalled the culture of"
52,9464,the French King.
52,9466,"In 1714 the Elector of Hanover became King of England, adding one"
52,9467,more to the list of monarchies half in and half out of the empire.
52,9469,The Austrian branch of the descendants of Charles V retained the
52,9470,title of Emperor; the Spanish branch retained Spain.  But now
52,9471,there was also an Emperor of the East again.  After the fall of
52,9472,"Constantinople (1453), the grand duke of Moscow, Ivan the Great"
52,9473,"(1462-1505), claimed to be heir to the Byzantine throne and"
52,9474,adopted the Byzantine double-headed eagle upon his arms.  His
52,9475,"grandson, Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible (1533-1584), assumed the"
52,9476,imperial title of Caesar (Tsar).  But only in the latter half of
52,9477,the seventeenth century did Russia cease to seem remote and
52,9478,Asiatic to the European mind.  The Tsar Peter the Great
52,9479,(1682-1725) brought Russia into the arena of Western affairs.  He
52,9480,"built a new capital for his empire, Petersburg upon the Neva, that"
52,9481,"played the part of a window between Russia and Europe, and he set"
52,9482,"up his Versailles at Peterhof eighteen miles away, employing a"
52,9483,"French architect who gave him a terrace, fountains, cascades,"
52,9484,"picture gallery, park and all the recognized appointments of Grand"
52,9485,Monarchy.  In Russia as in Prussia French became the language of
52,9486,the court.
52,9488,"Unhappily placed between Austria, Prussia and Russia was the"
52,9489,"Polish kingdom, an ill-organized state of great landed proprietors"
52,9490,too jealous of their own individual grandeur to permit more than a
52,9491,nominal kingship to the monarch they elected.  Her fate was
52,9492,"division among these three neighbours, in spite of the efforts of"
52,9493,France to retain her as an independent ally.  Switzerland at this
52,9494,time was a group of republican cantons; Venice was a republic;
52,9495,Italy like so much of Germany was divided among minor dukes and
52,9496,"princes.  The Pope ruled like a prince in the papal states, too"
52,9497,fearful now of losing the allegiance of the remaining Catholic
52,9498,princes to interfere between them and their subjects or to remind
52,9499,the world of the commonweal of Christendom. There remained indeed
52,9500,no common {328} political idea in Europe at all; Europe was given
52,9501,over altogether to division and diversity.
52,9503,All these sovereign princes and republics carried on schemes of
52,9504,aggrandizement against each other.  Each one of them pursued a
52,9505,"""foreign policy"" of aggression against its neighbours and of"
52,9506,aggressive alliances.  We Europeans still live to-day in the last
52,9507,"phase of this age of the multifarious sovereign states, and still"
52,9508,"suffer from the hatreds, hostilities and suspicions it engendered."
52,9509,The history of this time becomes more and more manifestly
52,9510,"""gossip,"" more and more unmeaning and wearisome to a modern"
52,9511,intelligence.  You are told of how this war was caused by this
52,9512,"King's mistress, and how the jealousy of one minister for another"
52,9513,caused that.  A tittle-tattle of bribes and rivalries disgusts the
52,9514,intelligent student.  The more permanently significant fact is
52,9515,"that in spite of the obstruction of a score of frontiers, reading"
52,9516,and thought still spread and increased and inventions multiplied.
52,9517,The eighteenth century saw the appearance of a literature
52,9518,profoundly sceptical and critical of the courts and policies of
52,9519,the time.  In such a book as Voltaire's _Candide_ we have the
52,9520,expression of an infinite weariness with the planless confusion of
52,9521,the European world.
53,9533,"While Central Europe thus remained divided and confused, the"
53,9534,"Western Europeans and particularly the Dutch, the Scandinavians,"
53,9535,"the Spanish, the Portuguese, the French and the British were"
53,9536,extending the area of their struggles across the seas of all the
53,9537,world.  The printing press had dissolved the political ideas of
53,9538,"Europe into a vast and at first indeterminate fermentation, but"
53,9539,"that other great innovation, the ocean-going sailing ship, was"
53,9540,inexorably extending the range of European experience to the
53,9541,furthermost limits of salt water.
53,9543,The first overseas settlements of the Dutch and Northern Atlantic
53,9544,Europeans were not for colonization but for trade and mining.  The
53,9545,Spaniards were first in the field; they claimed dominion over the
53,9546,whole of this new world of America.  Very soon however the
53,9547,Portuguese asked for a share.  The Pope--it was one of the last
53,9548,acts of Rome as mistress of the world--divided the new continent
53,9549,"between these two first-comers, giving Portugal Brazil and"
53,9550,everything else east of a line 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde
53,9551,"islands, and all the rest to Spain (1494).  The Portuguese at this"
53,9552,time were also pushing overseas enterprise southward and eastward.
53,9553,In 1497 Vasco da Gama had sailed from Lisbon round the Cape to
53,9554,Zanzibar and then to Calicut in India.  In 1515 there were
53,9555,"Portuguese ships in Java and the Moluccas, and the Portuguese were"
53,9556,setting up and fortifying trading stations round and about the
53,9557,"coasts of the Indian Ocean.  Mozambique, Goa, and two smaller"
53,9558,"possessions in India, Macao in China and a part of Timor are to"
53,9559,this day Portuguese possessions.
53,9561,The nations excluded from America by the papal settlement paid
53,9562,"little heed to the rights of Spain and Portugal.  The English, the"
53,9563,"Danes and Swedes, and presently the Dutch, were soon staking {330}"
53,9564,"out claims in North America and the West Indies, and his Most"
53,9565,Catholic Majesty of France heeded the papal settlement as little
53,9566,as any Protestant.  The wars of Europe extended themselves to
53,9567,these claims and possessions.
53,9571,In the long run the English were the most successful in this
53,9572,scramble for overseas possessions. The Danes and Swedes were too
53,9573,{331} deeply entangled in the complicated affairs of Germany to
53,9574,sustain effective expeditions abroad.  Sweden was wasted upon the
53,9575,"German battlefields by a picturesque king, Gustavus Adolphus, the"
53,9576,"Protestant ""Lion of the North.""  The Dutch were the heirs of such"
53,9577,"small settlements as Sweden made in America, and the Dutch were"
53,9578,too near French aggressions to hold their own against the British.
53,9579,"In the far East the chief rivals for empire were the British,"
53,9580,"Dutch and French, and in America the British, French and Spanish."
53,9581,"The British had the supreme advantage of a water frontier, the"
53,9582,"""silver streak"" of the English Channel, against Europe.  The"
53,9583,tradition of the Latin Empire entangled them least.
53,9587,France has always thought too much in terms of Europe.  Throughout
53,9588,the eighteenth century she was wasting her opportunities of
53,9589,"expansion in West and East alike in order to dominate Spain, Italy"
53,9590,and the German confusion.  The religious and political dissensions
53,9591,of Britain in the seventeenth century had driven many {332} of the
53,9592,English to seek a permanent home in America.  They struck root and
53,9593,"increased and multiplied, giving the British a great advantage in"
53,9594,the American struggle.  In 1756 and 1760 the French lost Canada to
53,9595,"the British and their American colonists, and a few years later"
53,9596,the British trading company found itself completely dominant over
53,9597,"French, Dutch and Portuguese in the peninsula of India.  The great"
53,9598,"Mongol Empire of Baber, Akbar and their successors had now far"
53,9599,"gone in decay, and the story of its practical capture by a London"
53,9600,"trading company, the British East India Company, is one of the"
53,9601,most extraordinary episodes in the whole history of conquest.
53,9605,This East India Company had been originally at the time of its
53,9606,incorporation under Queen Elizabeth no more than a company of sea
53,9607,adventurers.  Step by step they had been forced to raise troops
53,9608,"and arm their ships.  And now this trading company, with its"
53,9609,"tradition of gain, found itself dealing not merely in spices and"
53,9610,"dyes and tea and jewels, but in the revenues and territories of"
53,9611,princes {333} and the destinies of India.  It had come to buy and
53,9612,"sell, and it found itself achieving a tremendous piracy.  There"
53,9613,was no one to challenge its proceedings.  Is it any wonder that
53,9614,"its captains and commanders and officials, nay, even its clerks"
53,9615,"and common soldiers, came back to England loaded with spoils?"
53,9617,"Men under such circumstances, with a great and wealthy land at"
53,9618,"their mercy, could not determine what they might or might not do."
53,9619,"It was a strange land to them, with a strange sunlight; its brown"
53,9620,"people seemed a different race, outside their range of sympathy;"
53,9621,its mysterious temples sustained fantastic standards of behaviour.
53,9622,Englishmen at home were perplexed when presently these generals
53,9623,and officials came back to make dark accusations against each
53,9624,other of extortions and cruelties.  Upon Clive Parliament passed a
53,9625,vote of censure.  He committed suicide in 1774.  In 1788 Warren
53,9626,"Hastings, a second great Indian administrator, was impeached and"
53,9627,acquitted (1792).  It was a strange and unprecedented situation in
53,9628,the world's history.  The English Parliament found itself ruling
53,9629,"over a London trading company, which in its turn was dominating an"
53,9630,empire far greater and more populous than all the domains of the
53,9631,British crown.  To the bulk of the English people India was a
53,9632,"remote, fantastic, almost inaccessible land, to which adventurous"
53,9633,"poor young men went out, to return after many years very rich and"
53,9634,very choleric old gentlemen.  It was difficult for the English to
53,9635,conceive what the life of these countless brown millions in the
53,9636,eastern sunshine could be.  Their imaginations declined the task.
53,9637,India remained romantically unreal.  It was impossible for the
53,9638,"English, therefore, to exert any effective supervision and control"
53,9639,over the company's proceedings.
53,9641,And while the Western European powers were thus fighting for these
53,9642,"fantastic overseas empires upon every ocean in the world, two"
53,9643,great land conquests were in progress in Asia.  China had thrown
53,9644,"off the Mongol yoke in 1360, and flourished under the great native"
53,9645,"dynasty of the Mings until 1644.  Then the Manchus, another Mongol"
53,9646,"people, reconquered China and remained masters of China until"
53,9647,1912.  Meanwhile Russia was pushing East and growing to greatness
53,9648,in the world's affairs.  The rise of this great central power of
53,9649,"the old world, which is neither altogether of the East nor {334}"
53,9650,"altogether of the West, is one of the utmost importance to our"
53,9651,human destiny.  Its expansion is very largely due to the
53,9652,"appearance of a Christian steppe people, the Cossacks, who formed"
53,9653,a barrier between the feudal agriculture of Poland and Hungary to
53,9654,the west and the Tartar to the east.  The Cossacks were the wild
53,9655,"east of Europe, and in many ways not unlike the wild west of the"
53,9656,United States in the middle nineteenth century.  All who had made
53,9657,"Russia too hot to hold them, criminals as well as the persecuted"
53,9658,"innocent, rebellious serfs, religious secretaries, thieves,"
53,9659,"vagabonds, murderers, sought asylum in the southern steppes and"
53,9660,there made a fresh start and fought for life and freedom against
53,9661,"Pole, Russian and Tartar alike.  Doubtless fugitives from the"
53,9662,Tartars to the east also contributed to the Cossack mixture.
53,9663,Slowly these border folk were incorporated in the Russian imperial
53,9664,"service, much as the highland clans of Scotland were converted"
53,9665,into regiments by the British government.  New lands were offered
53,9666,them in Asia.  They became a weapon against the dwindling power of
53,9667,"the Mongolian nomads, first in Turkestan and then across Siberia"
53,9668,as far as the Amur.
53,9670,The decay of Mongol energy in the seventeenth and eighteenth
53,9671,centuries is very difficult to explain.  Within two or three
53,9672,centuries from the days of Jengis and Timurlane Central Asia had
53,9673,relapsed from a period of world ascendancy to extreme political
53,9674,"impotence.  Changes of climate, unrecorded pestilences, infections"
53,9675,"of a malarial type, may have played their part in this"
53,9676,recession--which may be only a temporary recession measured by the
53,9677,scale of universal history--of the Central Asian peoples.  Some
53,9678,authorities think that the spread of Buddhist teaching from China
53,9679,"also had a pacifying influence upon them.  At any rate, by the"
53,9680,"sixteenth century the Mongol, Tartar and Turkish peoples were no"
53,9681,"longer pressing outward, but were being invaded, subjugated and"
53,9682,pushed back both by Christian Russia in the west and by China in
53,9683,the east.
53,9685,All through the seventeenth century the Cossacks were spreading
53,9686,"eastward from European Russia, and settling wherever they found"
53,9687,agricultural conditions.  Cordons of forts and stations formed a
53,9688,"moving frontier to these settlements to the south, where the"
53,9689,"Turkomans were still strong and active; to the north-east,"
53,9690,"however, Russia had no frontier until she reached right to the"
53,9691,Pacific ....
54,9703,The third quarter of the eighteenth century thus saw the
54,9704,remarkable and unstable spectacle of a Europe divided against
54,9705,"itself, and no longer with any unifying political or religious"
54,9706,"idea, yet through the immense stimulation of men's imaginations by"
54,9707,"the printed book, the printed map, and the opportunity of the new"
54,9708,"ocean-going shipping, able in a disorganized and contentious"
54,9709,manner to dominate all the coasts of the world.  It was a
54,9710,"planless, incoherent ebullition of enterprise due to temporary and"
54,9711,almost accidental advantages over the rest of mankind.  By virtue
54,9712,of these advantages this new and still largely empty continent of
54,9713,"America was peopled mainly from Western European sources, and"
54,9714,South Africa and Australia and New Zealand marked down as
54,9715,prospective homes for a European population.
54,9717,The motive that had sent Columbus to America and Vasco da Gama to
54,9718,India was the perennial first motive of all sailors since the
54,9719,beginning of things--trade.  But while in the already populous and
54,9720,"productive East the trade motive remained dominant, and the"
54,9721,European settlements remained trading settlements from which the
54,9722,"European inhabitants hoped to return home to spend their money,"
54,9723,"the Europeans in America, dealing with communities at a very much"
54,9724,"lower level of productive activity, found a new inducement for"
54,9725,persistence in the search for gold and silver.  Particularly did
54,9726,the mines of Spanish America yield silver.  The Europeans had to
54,9727,"go to America not simply as armed merchants but as prospectors,"
54,9728,"miners, searchers after natural products, and presently as"
54,9729,planters.  In the north they sought furs.  Mines and plantations
54,9730,necessitated settlements.  They obliged people to set up permanent
54,9731,"overseas homes.  Finally in some cases, as when the English"
54,9732,Puritans went to New England in the early seventeenth {336}
54,9733,"century to escape religious persecution, when in the eighteenth"
54,9734,Oglethorpe sent people from the English debtors' prisons to
54,9735,"Georgia, and when in the end of the eighteenth the Dutch sent"
54,9736,"orphans to the Cape of Good Hope, the Europeans frankly crossed"
54,9737,"the seas to find new homes for good.  In the nineteenth century,"
54,9738,"and especially after the coming of the steamship, the stream of"
54,9739,European emigration to the new empty lands of America and
54,9740,Australia rose for some decades to the scale of a great migration.
54,9742,"So there grew up permanent overseas populations of Europeans, and"
54,9743,the European culture was transplanted to much larger areas than
54,9744,those in which it had been developed.  These new communities
54,9745,bringing a ready-made civilization with them to these new lands
54,9746,"grew up, as it were, unplanned and unperceived; the statecraft of"
54,9747,"Europe did not foresee them, and was unprepared with any ideas"
54,9748,about their treatment.  The politicians and ministers of Europe
54,9749,continued to regard them as essentially expeditionary
54,9750,"establishments, sources of revenue, ""possessions"" and"
54,9751,"""dependencies,"" long after their peoples had developed a keen"
54,9752,sense of their separate social life.  And also they continued to
54,9753,treat them as helplessly subject to the mother country long after
54,9754,the population had spread inland out of reach of any effectual
54,9755,punitive operations from the sea.
54,9757,"Because until right into the nineteenth century, it must be"
54,9758,"remembered, the link of all these overseas empires was the"
54,9759,oceangoing sailing ship.  On land the swiftest thing was still the
54,9760,"horse, and the cohesion and unity of political systems on land was"
54,9761,still limited by the limitations of horse communications.
54,9763,Now at the end of the third quarter of the eighteenth century the
54,9764,northern two-thirds of North America was under the British crown.
54,9765,"France had abandoned America.  Except for Brazil, which was"
54,9766,"Portuguese, and one or two small islands and areas in French,"
54,9767,"British, Danish and Dutch hands, Florida, Louisiana, California"
54,9768,and all America to the south was Spanish.  It was the British
54,9769,colonies south of Maine and Lake Ontario that first demonstrated
54,9770,the inadequacy of the sailing ship to hold overseas populations
54,9771,together in one political system.
54,9773,These British colonies were very miscellaneous in their origin and
54,9774,"character.  There were French, Swedish and Dutch settlements {337}"
54,9775,as well as British; there were British Catholics in Maryland and
54,9776,"British ultra-Protestants in New England, and while the New"
54,9777,"Englanders farmed their own land and denounced slavery, the"
54,9778,British in Virginia and the south were planters employing a
54,9779,swelling multitude of imported negro slaves.  There was no natural
54,9780,common unity in such states.  To get from one to the other might
54,9781,mean a coasting voyage hardly less tedious than the transatlantic
54,9782,crossing.  But the union that diverse origin and natural
54,9783,conditions denied the British Americans was forced upon them by
54,9784,the selfishness and stupidity of the British government in London.
54,9785,They were taxed without any voice in the spending of the taxes;
54,9786,their trade was sacrificed to British interests; the highly
54,9787,profitable slave trade was maintained by the British government in
54,9788,spite of the opposition of the Virginians
54,9789,who--though quite willing to hold and use slaves--feared to be
54,9790,swamped by an ever-growing barbaric black population.
54,9794,Britain at that time was lapsing towards an intenser form of
54,9795,"monarchy, and the obstinate personality of George III (1760-1820)"
54,9796,did much to force on a struggle between the home and the colonial
54,9797,governments.
54,9799,The conflict was precipitated by legislation which favoured the
54,9800,London East India Company at the expense of the American shipper.
54,9801,Three cargoes of tea which were imported under the new conditions
54,9802,were thrown overboard in Boston harbour by a band of men disguised
54,9803,as Indians (1773).  {338} Fighting only began in 1775 when the
54,9804,British government attempted to arrest two of the American leaders
54,9805,at Lexington near Boston.  The first shots were fired in Lexington
54,9806,by the British; the first fighting occurred at Concord.
54,9810,"So the American War of Independence began, though for more than a"
54,9811,year the colonists showed themselves extremely unwilling to sever
54,9812,their links with the mother land.  It was not until the middle of
54,9813,"1776 that the Congress of the insurgent states issued ""The"
54,9814,"Declaration of Independence.""  George Washington, who like many of"
54,9815,the leading colonists of the time had had a military training in
54,9816,"the wars against the French, was made commander-in-chief.  In 1777"
54,9817,"a British general, General Burgoyne, in an attempt to reach New"
54,9818,"York from Canada, was defeated at Freemans Farm and obliged to"
54,9819,surrender at Saratoga.  In the same year the French and Spanish
54,9820,"declared war upon Great Britain, greatly hampering her sea"
54,9821,communications.  A second British army under General Cornwallis
54,9822,was caught in the Yorktown peninsula in Virginia and obliged to
54,9823,"capitulate in 1781.  In 1783 peace was made in Paris, and the"
54,9824,Thirteen Colonies from Maine to Georgia became a union of
54,9825,independent sovereign States.  So the United States of America
54,9826,came into existence.  Canada remained loyal to the British flag.
54,9830,For four years these States had only a very feeble central
54,9831,"government under certain Articles of Confederation, and they"
54,9832,seemed destined to break up into separate independent communities.
54,9833,Their immediate separation was delayed by the hostility of the
54,9834,British and a certain aggressiveness on the part of the French
54,9835,which brought {340} home to them the immediate dangers of
54,9836,division.  A Constitution was drawn up and ratified in 1788
54,9837,establishing a more efficient Federal government with a President
54,9838,"holding very considerable powers, and the weak sense of national"
54,9839,unity was invigorated by a second war with Britain in 1812.
54,9840,Nevertheless the area covered by the States was so wide and their
54,9841,"interests so diverse at that time, that--given only the means of"
54,9842,communication then available--a disintegration of the Union into
54,9843,separate states on the European scale of size was merely a
54,9844,"question of time.  Attendance at Washington meant a long, tedious"
54,9845,and insecure journey for the senators and congressmen of the
54,9846,"remoter districts, and the mechanical impediments to the diffusion"
54,9847,of a common education and a common literature and intelligence
54,9848,were practically insurmountable.  Forces were at work in the world
54,9849,however that were to arrest the process of differentiation
54,9850,altogether.  Presently came the river steamboat and then the
54,9851,railway and the telegraph to save the United States from
54,9852,"fragmentation, and weave its dispersed people together again into"
54,9853,the first of great modern nations.
54,9855,Twenty-two years later the Spanish colonies in America were to
54,9856,follow the example of the Thirteen and break their connection with
54,9857,Europe.  But being more dispersed over the continent and separated
54,9858,by great mountainous chains and deserts and forests and by the
54,9859,"Portuguese Empire of Brazil, they did not achieve a union among"
54,9860,"themselves.  They became a constellation of republican states,"
54,9861,very prone at first to wars among themselves and to revolutions.
54,9863,Brazil followed a rather different line towards the inevitable
54,9864,separation.  In 1807 the French armies under Napoleon had occupied
54,9865,"the mother country of Portugal, and the monarchy had fled to"
54,9866,"Brazil.  From that time on until they separated, Portugal was"
54,9867,rather a dependency of Brazil than Brazil of Portugal.  In 1822
54,9868,"Brazil declared itself a separate Empire under Pedro I, a son of"
54,9869,the Portuguese King.  But the new world has never been very
54,9870,favourable to monarchy.  In 1889 the Emperor of Brazil was shipped
54,9871,"off quietly to Europe, and the United States of Brazil fell into"
54,9872,line with the rest of republican America.
55,9884,Britain had hardly lost the Thirteen Colonies in America before a
55,9885,profound social and political convulsion at the very heart of
55,9886,Grand Monarchy was to remind Europe still more vividly of the
55,9887,essentially temporary nature of the political arrangements of the
55,9888,world.
55,9890,We have said that the French monarchy was the most successful of
55,9891,the personal monarchies in Europe.  It was the envy and model of a
55,9892,multitude of competing and minor courts.  But it flourished on a
55,9893,basis of injustice that led to its dramatic collapse.  It was
55,9894,"brilliant and aggressive, but it was wasteful of the life and"
55,9895,substance of its common people.  The clergy and nobility were
55,9896,protected from taxation by a system of exemption that threw the
55,9897,whole burden of the state upon the middle and lower classes.  The
55,9898,peasants were ground down by taxation; the middle classes were
55,9899,dominated and humiliated by the nobility.
55,9901,In 1787 this French monarchy found itself bankrupt and obliged to
55,9902,call representatives of the different classes of the realm into
55,9903,consultation upon the perplexities of defective income and
55,9904,"excessive expenditure.  In 1789 the States General, a gathering of"
55,9905,"the nobles, clergy and commons, roughly equivalent to the earlier"
55,9906,"form of the British Parliament, was called together at Versailles."
55,9907,It had not assembled since 1610.  For all that time France had
55,9908,been an absolute monarchy.  Now the people found a means of
55,9909,expressing their long fermenting discontent.  Disputes immediately
55,9910,"broke out between the three estates, due to the resolve of the"
55,9911,"Third Estate, the Commons, to control the Assembly.  The Commons"
55,9912,got the better of these disputes and the States General became a
55,9913,"National Assembly, clearly resolved to keep the crown in order, as"
55,9914,the British {342} Parliament kept the British crown in order.  The
55,9915,king (Louis XVI) prepared for a struggle and brought up troops
55,9916,from the provinces.  Whereupon Paris and France revolted.
55,9918,The collapse of the absolute monarchy was very swift.  The
55,9919,grim-looking prison of the Bastille was stormed by the people of
55,9920,"Paris, and the insurrection spread rapidly throughout France.  In"
55,9921,the east and north-west provinces many chateaux belonging to the
55,9922,"nobility were burnt by the peasants, their title-deeds carefully"
55,9923,"destroyed, and the owners murdered or driven away.  In a month the"
55,9924,ancient and decayed system of the aristocratic order had
55,9925,collapsed.  Many of the leading princes and courtiers of the
55,9926,queen's party fled abroad.  A provisional city government was set
55,9927,"up in Paris and in most of the other large cities, and a new armed"
55,9928,"force, the National Guard, a force designed primarily and plainly"
55,9929,"to resist the forces of the crown, was brought into existence by"
55,9930,these municipal bodies.  The National Assembly found itself called
55,9931,upon to create a new political and social system for a new age.
55,9933,It was a task that tried the powers of that gathering to the
55,9934,utmost.  It made a great sweep of the chief injustices of the
55,9935,"absolutist regime; it abolished tax exemptions, serfdom,"
55,9936,aristocratic titles and privileges and sought to establish a
55,9937,constitutional monarchy in Paris.  The king abandoned Versailles
55,9938,and its splendours and kept a diminished state in the palace of
55,9939,the Tuileries in Paris.
55,9941,For two years it seemed that the National Assembly might struggle
55,9942,through to an effective modernized government.  Much of its work
55,9943,"was sound and still endures, if much was experimental and had to"
55,9944,be undone.  Much was ineffective.  There was a clearing up of the
55,9945,"penal code; torture, arbitrary imprisonment and persecutions for"
55,9946,"heresy were abolished.  The ancient provinces of France, Normandy,"
55,9947,Burgundy and the like gave place to eighty departments.  Promotion
55,9948,to the highest ranks in the army was laid open to men of every
55,9949,"class.  An excellent and simple system of law courts was set up,"
55,9950,but its value was much vitiated by having the judges appointed by
55,9951,popular election for short periods of time.  This made the crowd a
55,9952,"sort of final court of appeal, and the judges, like the members of"
55,9953,"the Assembly, were forced to play to the gallery.  And the whole"
55,9954,vast property of the church was seized and administered {343} by
55,9955,the state; religious establishments not engaged in education or
55,9956,"works of charity were broken up, and the salaries of the clergy"
55,9957,made a charge upon the nation.  This in itself was not a bad thing
55,9958,"for the lower clergy in France, who were often scandalously"
55,9959,underpaid in comparison with the richer dignitaries.  But in
55,9960,"addition the choice of priests and bishops was made elective,"
55,9961,"which struck at the very root idea of the Roman Church, which"
55,9962,"centred everything upon the Pope, and in which all authority is"
55,9963,from above downward.  Practically the National Assembly wanted at
55,9964,"one blow to make the church in France Protestant, in organization"
55,9965,if not in doctrine.  Everywhere there were disputes and conflicts
55,9966,between the state priests created by the National Assembly and the
55,9967,recalcitrant (non-juring) priests who were loyal to Rome.
55,9969,In 1791 the experiment of Constitutional monarchy in France was
55,9970,"brought to an abrupt end by the action of the king and queen,"
55,9971,working in concert with their aristocratic and monarchist friends
55,9972,abroad.  Foreign armies gathered on the Eastern frontier and one
55,9973,night in June the king and queen and their children slipped away
55,9974,from the Tuileries and fled to join the foreigners and the
55,9975,aristocratic exiles.  They were caught at Varennes and brought
55,9976,"back to Paris, and an France flamed up into a passion of patriotic"
55,9977,"republicanism.  A Republic was proclaimed, open war with Austria"
55,9978,"and Prussia ensued, and the king was tried and executed (January,"
55,9979,"1793) on the model already set by England, for treason to his"
55,9980,people.
55,9982,And now followed a strange phase in the history of the French
55,9983,people.  There arose a great flame of enthusiasm for France and
55,9984,the Republic.  There was to be an end to compromise at home and
55,9985,abroad; at home royalists and every form of disloyalty were to be
55,9986,stamped out; abroad France was to be the protector and helper of
55,9987,"all revolutionaries.  All Europe, all the world, was to become"
55,9988,Republican.  The youth of France poured into the Republican
55,9989,"armies; a new and wonderful song spread through the land, a song"
55,9990,"that still warms the blood like wine, the Marseillaise.  Before"
55,9991,that chant and the leaping columns of French bayonets and their
55,9992,enthusiastically served guns the foreign armies rolled back;
55,9993,before the end of 1792 the French armies had gone far beyond the
55,9994,utmost achievements of Louis XIV; everywhere they stood on {344}
55,9995,"foreign soil.  They were in Brussels, they had overrun Savoy, they"
55,9996,had raided to Mayence; they had seized the Scheldt from Holland.
55,9997,Then the French Government did an unwise thing.  It had been
55,9998,exasperated by the expulsion of its representative from England
55,9999,"upon the execution of Louis, and it declared war against England."
55,10000,"It was an unwise thing to do, because the revolution which had"
55,10001,given France a new enthusiastic infantry and a brilliant artillery
55,10002,released from its aristocratic officers and many cramping
55,10003,"conditions had destroyed the discipline of the navy, and the"
55,10004,English were supreme upon the sea.  And this provocation united
55,10005,"all England against France, whereas there had been at first a very"
55,10006,considerable liberal movement in Great Britain in sympathy with
55,10007,the revolution.
55,10011,Of the fight that France made in the next few years against a
55,10012,European coalition we cannot tell in any detail.  She drove the
55,10013,"Austrians for ever out of Belgium, and made Holland a republic."
55,10014,"The Dutch fleet, frozen in the Texel, surrendered to a handful of"
55,10015,{345} cavalry without firing its guns.  For some time the French
55,10016,"thrust towards Italy was hung up, and it was only in 1796 that a"
55,10017,"new general, Napoleon Bonaparte, led the ragged and hungry"
55,10018,republican armies in triumph across Piedmont to Mantua and Verona.
55,10019,"Says C. F. Atkinson,  [7]  ""What astonished the Allies most of all"
55,10020,was the number and the velocity of the Republicans.  These
55,10021,improvised armies had in fact nothing to delay them.  Tents were
55,10022,"unprocurable for want of money, untransportable for want of the"
55,10023,"enormous number of wagons that would have been required, and also"
55,10024,"unnecessary, for the discomfort that would have caused wholesale"
55,10025,desertion in professional armies was cheerfully borne by the men
55,10026,of 1793-94.   Supplies for armies of then unheard-of size could
55,10027,"not be carried in convoys, and the French soon became familiar"
55,10028,with 'living on the country.'  Thus 1793 saw the birth of the
55,10029,"modern system of war--rapidity of movement, full development of"
55,10030,"national strength, bivouacs, requisitions and force as against"
55,10031,"cautious manoeuvring, small professional armies, tents and full"
55,10032,"rations, and chicane.  The first represented the"
55,10033,"decision-compelling spirit, the second the spirit of risking"
55,10034,"little to gain a little ... ."""
55,10036,And while these ragged hosts of enthusiasts were chanting the
55,10037,"Marseillaise and fighting for _la France_, manifestly never quite"
55,10038,clear in their minds whether they were looting or liberating the
55,10039,"countries into which they poured, the republican enthusiasm in"
55,10040,Paris was spending itself in a far less glorious fashion.  The
55,10041,"revolution was now under the sway of a fanatical leader,"
55,10042,Robespierre.  This man is difficult to judge; he was a man of poor
55,10043,"physique, naturally timid, and a prig.  But he had that most"
55,10044,"necessary gift for power, faith.  He set himself to save the"
55,10045,"Republic as he conceived it, and he imagined it could be saved by"
55,10046,no other man than he.  So that to keep in power was to save the
55,10047,"Republic.  The living spirit of the Republic, it seemed, had"
55,10048,sprung from a slaughter of royalists and the execution of the
55,10049,"king.  There were insurrections; one in the west, in the district"
55,10050,"of La Vendee, where the people rose against the conscription and"
55,10051,"against the dispossession of the orthodox clergy, and were led by"
55,10052,"noblemen and priests; one in the south, where Lyons and Marseilles"
55,10053,had risen and the royalists of Toulon {346} had admitted an
55,10054,English and Spanish garrison.  To which there seemed no more
55,10055,effectual reply than to go on killing royalists.
55,10057,"The Revolutionary Tribunal went to work, and a steady slaughtering"
55,10058,began.  The invention of the guillotine was opportune to this
55,10059,"mood.  The queen was guillotined, most of Robespierre's"
55,10060,"antagonists were guillotined, atheists who argued that there was"
55,10061,"no Supreme Being were guillotined; day by day, week by week, this"
55,10062,infernal new machine chopped off heads and more heads and more.
55,10063,"The reign of Robespierre lived, it seemed, on blood; and needed"
55,10064,"more and more, as an opium-taker needs more and more opium."
55,10069,Finally in the summer of 1794 Robespierre himself was overthrown
55,10070,and guillotined.  He was succeeded by a Directory of five men
55,10071,which carried on the war of defence abroad and held France
55,10072,together at home for five years.  Their reign formed a curious
55,10073,interlude in this history of violent changes.  They took things
55,10074,{347} as they found them.  The propagandist zeal of the revolution
55,10075,"carried the French armies into Holland, Belgium, Switzerland,"
55,10076,south Germany and north Italy.  Everywhere kings were expelled and
55,10077,republics set up.  But such propagandist zeal as animated the
55,10078,Directorate did not prevent the looting of the treasures of the
55,10079,liberated peoples to relieve the financial embarrassment of the
55,10080,French Government.  Their wars became less and less the holy wars
55,10081,"of freedom, and more and more like the aggressive wars of the"
55,10082,ancient regime.  The last feature of Grand Monarchy that France
55,10083,was disposed to discard was her tradition of foreign policy.  One
55,10084,discovers it still as vigorous under the Directorate as if there
55,10085,had been no revolution.
55,10087,Unhappily for France and the world a man arose who embodied in its
55,10088,intensest form this national egotism of the French.  He gave that
55,10089,country ten years of glory and the humiliation of a final defeat.
55,10090,This was that same Napoleon Bonaparte who had led the armies of
55,10091,the Directory to victory in Italy.
55,10093,Throughout the five years of the Directorate he had been scheming
55,10094,and working for self-advancement.  Gradually he clambered to
55,10095,supreme power.  He was a man of severely limited understanding but
55,10096,of ruthless directness and great energy.  He had begun life as an
55,10097,extremist of the school of Robespierre; he owed his first
55,10098,promotion to that side; but he had no real grasp of the new forces
55,10099,that were working in Europe.  His utmost political imagination
55,10100,carried him to a belated and tawdry attempt to restore the Western
55,10101,Empire.  He tried to destroy the remains of the old Holy Roman
55,10102,"Empire, intending to replace it by a new one centring upon Paris."
55,10103,The Emperor in Vienna ceased to be the Holy Roman Emperor and
55,10104,became simply Emperor of Austria.  Napoleon divorced his French
55,10105,wife in order to marry an Austrian princess.
55,10107,"He became practically monarch of France as First Consul in 1799,"
55,10108,and he made himself Emperor of France in 1804 in direct imitation
55,10109,"of Charlemagne.  He was crowned by the Pope in Paris, taking the"
55,10110,crown from the Pope and putting it upon his own head himself as
55,10111,Charlemagne had directed.  His son was crowned King of Rome.
55,10113,For some years Napoleon's reign was a career of victory.  He {348}
55,10114,"conquered most of Italy and Spain, defeated Prussia and Austria,"
55,10115,and dominated all Europe west of Russia.  But he never won the
55,10116,command of the sea from the British and his fleets sustained a
55,10117,conclusive defeat inflicted by the British Admiral Nelson at
55,10118,Trafalgar (1805).  Spain rose against him in 1808 and a British
55,10119,army under Wellington thrust the French armies slowly northward
55,10120,out of the peninsula.  In 1811 Napoleon came into conflict with
55,10121,"the Tsar Alexander I, and in 1812 he invaded Russia with a great"
55,10122,"conglomerate army of 600,000 men, that was defeated and largely"
55,10123,destroyed by the Russians and the Russian winter.  Germany rose
55,10124,"against him, Sweden turned against him.  The French armies were"
55,10125,beaten back and at Fontainebleau Napoleon abdicated (1814).  He
55,10126,"was exiled to Elba, returned to France for one last effort in 1815"
55,10127,"and was defeated by the allied British, Belgians and Prussians at"
55,10128,Waterloo.  He died a British prisoner at St. Helena in 1821.
55,10130,The forces released by the French revolution were wasted and
55,10131,finished.  A great Congress of the victorious allies met at Vienna
55,10132,to restore as far as possible the state of affairs that the great
55,10133,"storm had rent to pieces.  For nearly forty years a sort of peace,"
55,10134,"a peace of exhausted effort, was maintained in Europe."
55,10136,"[7]  In his article, ""French Revolutionary Wars,"" in the"
55,10137,Encyclopaedia Britannica.
56,10149,Two main causes prevented that period from being a complete social
56,10150,"and international peace, and prepared the way for the cycle of"
56,10151,wars between 1854 and 1871.  The first of these was the tendency
56,10152,"of the royal courts concerned, towards the restoration of unfair"
56,10153,privilege and interference with freedom of thought and writing and
56,10154,teaching.  The second was the impossible system of boundaries
56,10155,drawn by the diplomatists of Vienna.
56,10157,The inherent disposition of monarchy to march back towards past
56,10158,conditions was first and most particularly manifest in Spain.
56,10159,Here even the Inquisition was restored.  Across the Atlantic the
56,10160,Spanish colonies had followed the example of the United States and
56,10161,"revolted against the European Great Power System, when Napoleon"
56,10162,set his brother Joseph on the Spanish throne in 1810.  The George
56,10163,Washington of South America was General Bolivar.  Spain was unable
56,10164,"to suppress this revolt, it dragged on much as the United States"
56,10165,"War of Independence had dragged on, and at last the suggestion was"
56,10166,"made by Austria, in accordance with the spirit of the Holy"
56,10167,"Alliance, that the European monarch should assist Spain in this"
56,10168,"struggle.  This was opposed by Britain in Europe, but it was the"
56,10169,prompt action of President Monroe of the United States in 1823
56,10170,which conclusively warned off this projected monarchist
56,10171,restoration.  He announced that the United States would regard any
56,10172,extension of the European system in the Western Hemisphere as a
56,10173,"hostile act.  Thus arose the Monroe Doctrine, the doctrine that"
56,10174,there must be no extension of extra-American government in
56,10175,"America, which has kept the Great Power system out of America for"
56,10176,nearly a hundred years and permitted the new states of Spanish
56,10177,America to work out their destinies along their own lines.
56,10181,"But if Spanish monarchism lost its colonies, it could at least,"
56,10182,"under the protection of the Concert of Europe, do what it chose in"
56,10183,Europe.  A popular insurrection in Spain was crushed by a French
56,10184,"army in 1823, with a mandate from a European congress, and"
56,10185,simultaneously Austria suppressed a revolution in Naples.
56,10187,"In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by Charles X.  Charles"
56,10188,"set himself to destroy the liberty of the press and universities,"
56,10189,and to restore absolute government; the sum of a billion francs
56,10190,was voted to compensate the nobles for the chateau burnings and
56,10191,sequestrations of 1789.  In 1830 Paris rose against this
56,10192,"embodiment of the ancient regime, and replaced him by Louis"
56,10193,"Philippe, the son of that Philip, Duke of Orleans, who was"
56,10194,"executed during the Terror.  The other continental monarchies, in"
56,10195,face of the open approval of the revolution by Great Britain and a
56,10196,"strong liberal ferment in Germany and Austria, did not interfere"
56,10197,"in this affair.  After all, France was still a monarchy.  This man"
56,10198,Louis Philippe (1830-48) remained the constitutional King of
56,10199,France for eighteen years.
56,10201,Such were the uneasy swayings of the peace of the Congress of
56,10202,"Vienna, which were provoked by the reactionary proceedings of the"
56,10203,monarchists.  The stresses that arose from the unscientific
56,10204,boundaries planned by the diplomatists at Vienna gathered force
56,10205,"more deliberately, but they were even more dangerous to the peace"
56,10206,of mankind.  It is extraordinarily inconvenient to administer
56,10207,together the affairs of peoples speaking different languages and
56,10208,so reading different literatures and having different general
56,10209,"ideas, especially if those differences are exacerbated by"
56,10210,"religious disputes.  Only some strong mutual interest, such as the"
56,10211,"common defensive needs of the Swiss mountaineers, can justify a"
56,10212,close linking of peoples of dissimilar languages and faiths; and
56,10213,"even in Switzerland there is the utmost local autonomy.  When, as"
56,10214,"in Macedonia, populations are mixed in a patchwork of villages and"
56,10215,"districts, the cantonal system is imperatively needed.  But if the"
56,10216,reader will look at the map of Europe as the Congress of Vienna
56,10217,"drew it, he will see that this gathering seems almost as if it had"
56,10218,planned the maximum of local exasperation.
56,10220,"It destroyed the Dutch Republic, quite needlessly, it lumped {351}"
56,10221,together the Protestant Dutch with the French-speaking Catholics
56,10222,"of the old Spanish (Austrian) Netherlands, and set up a kingdom of"
56,10223,the Netherlands.  It handed over not merely the old republic of
56,10224,"Venice, but all of North Italy as far as Milan to the"
56,10225,German-speaking Austrians.  French-speaking Savoy it combined with
56,10226,pieces of Italy to restore the kingdom of Sardinia.  Austria and
56,10227,"Hungary, already a sufficiently explosive mixture of discordant"
56,10228,"nationalities, Germans, Hungarians, Czecho-Slovaks, Jugo-Slavs,"
56,10229,"Roumanians, and now Italians, was made still more impossible by"
56,10230,confirming Austria's Polish acquisitions of 1772 and 1795.  The
56,10231,Catholic and republican-spirited Polish people were chiefly given
56,10232,over to the less civilized rule of the
56,10233,"Greek-orthodox Tsar, but important districts went to Protestant"
56,10234,Prussia.  The Tsar was also confirmed in his acquisition of the
56,10235,entirely alien Finns.  The very dissimilar Norwegian and Swedish
56,10236,"peoples were bound together under one king.  Germany, the reader"
56,10237,"will see, was left in a particularly dangerous state of muddle."
56,10238,Prussia and Austria were both partly in and partly out of a German
56,10239,"confederation, which included a multitude of minor states.  The"
56,10240,King of Denmark came into the German confederation by virtue of
56,10241,certain German-speaking possessions in Holstein.  Luxembourg was
56,10242,"included in the German confederation, though its ruler was also"
56,10243,"King of the Netherlands, and though many of its peoples talked"
56,10244,French.
56,10246,Here was a complete disregard of the fact that the people who talk
56,10247,"German and base their ideas on German literature, the people who"
56,10248,"talk Italian and base their ideas on Italian literature, and the"
56,10249,"people who talk Polish and base their ideas on Polish literature,"
56,10250,will all be far better off and most helpful and least obnoxious to
56,10251,the rest of mankind if they conduct their own affairs in their own
56,10252,idiom within the ring-fence of their own speech.  Is it any wonder
56,10253,that one of the most popular songs in Germany during this period
56,10254,"declared that wherever the German tongue was spoken, there was the"
56,10255,German Fatherland!
56,10257,"In 1830 French-speaking Belgium, stirred up by the current"
56,10258,"revolution in France, revolted against its Dutch association in"
56,10259,"the kingdom of the Netherlands.  The powers, terrified at the"
56,10260,"possibilities of a republic or of annexation to France, hurried in"
56,10261,"to pacify {353} this situation, and gave the Belgians a monarch,"
56,10262,Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg Gotha.  There were also ineffectual
56,10263,"revolts in Italy and Germany in 1830, and a much more serious one"
56,10264,in Russian Poland.  A republican government held out in Warsaw for
56,10265,"a year against Nicholas I (who succeeded Alexander in 1825), and"
56,10266,was then stamped out of existence with great violence and cruelty.
56,10267,"The Polish language was banned, and the Greek Orthodox church was"
56,10268,substituted for the Roman Catholic as the state religion ....
56,10280,In 1821 there was an insurrection of the Greeks against the Turks.
56,10281,"For six years they fought a desperate war, while the governments"
56,10282,of Europe looked on.  Liberal opinion protested against this
56,10283,inactivity; volunteers from every European country joined the
56,10284,"insurgents, and at last Britain, France and Russia took joint"
56,10285,action.  The Turkish fleet was destroyed by the French and English
56,10286,"at the battle of Navarino (1827), and the Tsar invaded Turkey.  By"
56,10287,"the treaty of Adrianople (1829) Greece was declared free, but"
56,10288,{354} she was not permitted to resume her ancient republican
56,10289,"traditions.  A German king was found for Greece, one Prince Otto"
56,10290,"of Bavaria, and Christian governors were set up in the Danubian"
56,10291,provinces (which are now Roumania) and Serbia (a part of the
56,10292,Jugo-Slav region).  Much blood had still to run however before
56,10293,the Turk
56,10294,was altogether expelled from these lands.
57,10317,throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries no striking
57,10318,immediate results in political life.  Nor was it affecting popular
57,10319,thought very profoundly during this period.  These reactions were
57,10320,"to come later, and only in their full force in the latter half of"
57,10321,the nineteenth century.  It was a process that went on chiefly in
57,10322,a small world of prosperous and
57,10323,independent-spirited people.  Without what the English call the
57,10324,"""private gentleman,"" the scientific process could not have begun"
57,10325,"in Greece, and could not have been renewed in Europe.  The"
57,10326,universities played a part but not a leading part in the
57,10327,philosophical and scientific thought of this period.  Endowed
57,10328,"learning is apt to be timid and conservative learning, lacking in"
57,10329,"initiative and resistent to innovation, unless it has the spur of"
57,10330,contact with independent minds.
57,10332,We have already noted the formation of the Royal Society in 1662
57,10333,and its work in realizing the dream of Bacon's _New Atlantis_.
57,10334,Throughout the eighteenth century there was much clearing up of
57,10335,"general ideas about matter and motion, much mathematical advance,"
57,10336,a systematic development of the use of optical glass in microscope
57,10337,"and telescope, a renewed energy in classificatory natural {356}"
57,10338,"history, a great revival of anatomical science.  The science of"
57,10339,geology--foreshadowed by Aristotle and anticipated by Leonardo da
57,10340,Vinci (1452-1519)--began its great task of interpreting the Record
57,10341,of the Rocks.
57,10346,The progress of physical science reacted upon metallurgy.
57,10347,"Improved metallurgy, affording the possibility of a larger and"
57,10348,"bolder handling of masses of metal and other materials, reacted"
57,10349,upon practical inventions.  Machinery on a new scale and in a new
57,10350,abundance appeared to revolutionize industry.
57,10355,In 1804 Trevithick adapted the Watt engine to transport and made
57,10356,"the first locomotive.  In 1825 the first railway, between Stockton"
57,10357,"and Darlington, was opened, and Stephenson's ""Rocket,"" with a"
57,10358,"thirteen-ton train, got up to a speed of forty-four miles per"
57,10359,hour.  From 1830 onward railways multiplied.  By the middle of the
57,10360,century a network of railways had spread all over Europe.
57,10362,Here was a sudden change in what had long been a fixed condition
57,10363,"of human life, the maximum rate of land transport.  After the"
57,10364,"Russian disaster, Napoleon travelled from near Vilna to Paris in"
57,10365,"312 hours.  This was a journey of about 1,400 miles.  He was"
57,10366,"travelling with every conceivable advantage, and he averaged {357}"
57,10367,under 5 miles an hour.  An ordinary traveller could not have done
57,10368,this distance in twice the time.  These were about the same
57,10369,maximum rates of travel as held good between Rome and Gaul in the
57,10370,first century A.D.  Then suddenly came this tremendous change.
57,10371,The railways reduced this journey for any ordinary traveller to
57,10372,"less than forty-eight hours.  That is to say, they reduced the"
57,10373,chief European distances to about a tenth of what they had been.
57,10374,They made it possible to carry out administrative work in areas
57,10375,ten times as great as any that had hitherto been workable under
57,10376,one administration.  The full significance of that possibility in
57,10377,Europe still remains to be realized.  Europe is still netted in
57,10378,boundaries drawn in the horse and road era.  In America the
57,10379,"effects were immediate.  To the United States of America,"
57,10380,"sprawling westward, it meant the possibility of a continuous"
57,10381,"access to Washington, however far the frontier travelled across"
57,10382,"the continent.  It meant unity, sustained on a scale that would"
57,10383,otherwise have been impossible.
57,10387,"The steamboat was, if anything, a little ahead of the steam engine"
57,10388,"in its earlier phases.  There was a steamboat, the _Charlotte"
57,10389,"Dundas_, on the Firth of Clyde Canal in 1802, and in 1807 an"
57,10390,"American {358} named Fulton had a steamer, the Clermont, with"
57,10391,"British-built engines, upon the Hudson River above New York.  The"
57,10392,"first steamship to put to sea was also an American, the Phoenix,"
57,10393,"which went from New York (Hoboken) to Philadelphia.  So, too, was"
57,10394,the first ship using steam (she also had sails) to cross the
57,10395,"Atlantic, the Savannah (1819).  All these were paddle-wheel boats"
57,10396,and paddle-wheel boats are not adapted to work in heavy seas.  The
57,10397,"paddles smash too easily, and the boat is then disabled.  The"
57,10398,screw steamship followed rather slowly.  Many difficulties had to
57,10399,be surmounted before the screw was a practicable thing.  Not until
57,10400,the middle of the century did the tonnage of steamships upon the
57,10401,sea begin to overhaul that of sailing ships.  After that the
57,10402,evolution in sea transport was rapid.  For the first time men
57,10403,began to cross the seas and oceans with some certainty as to the
57,10404,"date of their arrival.  The transatlantic crossing, which had been"
57,10405,an uncertain adventure of several weeks--which might stretch to
57,10406,"months--was accelerated, until in 1910 it was brought down, in the"
57,10407,"case of the fastest boats, to under five days, with a practically"
57,10408,notifiable hour of arrival.
57,10410,Concurrently with the development of steam transport upon land and
57,10411,sea a new and striking addition to the facilities of human
57,10412,"intercourse arose out of the investigations of Volta, Galvani and"
57,10413,Faraday into various electrical phenomena.  The electric telegraph
57,10414,came into existence in 1835.  The first underseas cable was laid
57,10415,in 1851 between France and England.  In a few years the telegraph
57,10416,"system had spread over the civilized world, and news which had"
57,10417,hitherto travelled slowly from point to point became practically
57,10418,simultaneous throughout the earth.
57,10420,"These things, the steam railway and the electric telegraph, were"
57,10421,to the popular imagination of the middle nineteenth century the
57,10422,"most striking and revolutionary of inventions, but they were only"
57,10423,the most conspicuous and clumsy first fruits of a far more
57,10424,extensive process.  Technical knowledge and skill were developing
57,10425,"with an extraordinary rapidity, and to an extraordinary extent"
57,10426,measured by the progress of any previous age.  Far less
57,10427,"conspicuous at first in everyday life, but finally far more"
57,10428,"important, was the extension of man's power over various"
57,10429,structural materials.  Before the middle of the eighteenth century
57,10430,"iron was reduced from its ores by {359} means of wood charcoal,"
57,10431,"was handled in small pieces, and hammered and wrought into shape."
57,10432,It was material for a craftsman.  Quality and treatment were
57,10433,enormously dependent upon the experience and sagacity of the
57,10434,individual iron-worker.  The largest masses of iron that could be
57,10435,dealt with under those conditions amounted at most (in the
57,10436,sixteenth century) to two or three tons.  (There was a very
57,10437,"definite upward limit, therefore, to the size of cannon.)  The"
57,10438,blast-furnace rose in the eighteenth century and developed with
57,10439,the use of coke.  Not before the eighteenth century do we find
57,10440,rolled sheet iron (1728) and rolled rods and bars (1783).
57,10441,Nasmyth's steam hammer came as late as 1838.
57,10443,"The ancient world, because of its metallurgical inferiority, could"
57,10444,"not use steam.  The steam engine, even the primitive pumping"
57,10445,"engine, could not develop before sheet iron was available.  The"
57,10446,early engines seem to the modern eye very pitiful and clumsy bits
57,10447,"of ironmongery, but they were the utmost that the metallurgical"
57,10448,science of the time could do.  As late as 1856 came the Bessemer
57,10449,"process, and presently (1864) the open-hearth process, in which"
57,10450,"steel and every sort of iron could be melted, purified and cast in"
57,10451,a manner and upon a scale hitherto unheard of.  To-day in the
57,10452,electric furnace one may see tons of incandescent steel swirling
57,10453,about like boiling milk in a saucepan.  Nothing in the previous
57,10454,practical advances of mankind is comparable in its consequences to
57,10455,the complete mastery over enormous masses of steel and iron and
57,10456,over their texture and quality which man has now achieved.  The
57,10457,railways and early engines of all sorts were the mere first
57,10458,triumphs of the new metallurgical methods.  Presently came ships
57,10459,"of iron and steel, vast bridges, and a new way of building with"
57,10460,steel upon a gigantic scale.  Men realized too late that they had
57,10461,"planned their railways with far too timid a gauge, that they could"
57,10462,have organized their travelling with far more steadiness and
57,10463,comfort upon a much bigger scale.
57,10465,Before the nineteenth century there were no ships in the world
57,10466,"much over 2,000 tons burthen; now there is nothing wonderful about"
57,10467,"a 50,000-ton liner.  There are people who sneer at this kind of"
57,10468,"progress as being a progress in ""mere size,"" but that sort of"
57,10469,sneering merely marks the intellectual limitations of those who
57,10470,indulge in it.  {360} The great ship or the steel-frame building
57,10471,"is not, as they imagine, a magnified version of the small ship or"
57,10472,"building of the past; it is a thing different in kind, more"
57,10473,"lightly and strongly built, of finer and stronger materials;"
57,10474,instead of being a thing of precedent and
57,10475,"rule-of-thumb, it is a thing of subtle and intricate calculation."
57,10476,"In the old house or ship, matter was dominant--the material and"
57,10477,"its needs had to be slavishly obeyed; in the new, matter had been"
57,10478,"captured, changed, coerced.  Think of the coal and iron and sand"
57,10479,"dragged out of the banks and pits, wrenched, wrought, molten and"
57,10480,"cast, to be flung at last, a slender glittering pinnacle of steel"
57,10481,"and glass, six hundred feet above the crowded city!"
57,10483,We have given these particulars of the advance in man's knowledge
57,10484,of the metallurgy of steel and its results by way of illustration.
57,10485,A parallel story could be told of the metallurgy of copper and
57,10486,"tin, and of a multitude of metals, nickel and aluminium to name"
57,10487,"but two, unknown before the nineteenth century dawned.  It is in"
57,10488,"this great and growing mastery over substances, over different"
57,10489,"sorts of glass, over rocks and plasters and the like, over colours"
57,10490,"and textures, that the main triumphs of the mechanical revolution"
57,10491,have thus far been achieved.  Yet we are still in the stage of the
57,10492,"first fruits in the matter.  We have the power, but we have still"
57,10493,to learn how to use our power.  Many of the first employments of
57,10494,"these gifts of science have been vulgar, tawdry, stupid or"
57,10495,horrible.  The artist and the adaptor have still hardly begun to
57,10496,work with the endless variety of substances now at their disposal.
57,10498,Parallel with this extension of mechanical possibilities the new
57,10499,science of electricity grew up.  It was only in the eighties of
57,10500,the nineteenth century that this body of enquiry began to yield
57,10501,results to impress the vulgar mind.  Then suddenly came electric
57,10502,"light and electric traction, and the transmutation of forces, the"
57,10503,"possibility of sending power, that could be changed into"
57,10504,"mechanical motion or light or heat as one chose, along a copper"
57,10505,"wire, as water is sent along a pipe, began to come through to the"
57,10506,ideas of ordinary people....
57,10508,The British and French were at first the leading peoples in this
57,10509,"great proliferation of knowledge; but presently the Germans, who"
57,10510,"had learnt humility under Napoleon, showed such zeal and"
57,10511,pertinacity in scientific enquiry as to overhaul these leaders.
57,10512,British {361} science was largely the creation of Englishmen and
57,10513,Scotchmen working outside the ordinary centres of erudition.
57,10519,The universities of Britain were at this time in a state of
57,10520,"educational retrogression, largely given over to a pedantic"
57,10521,"conning of the Latin and Greek classics.  French education, too,"
57,10522,"was dominated by the classical tradition of the Jesuit schools,"
57,10523,and consequently it was not difficult for the Germans to organize
57,10524,"a body of investigators, small indeed in relation to the"
57,10525,"possibilities of the case, but large in proportion to the little"
57,10526,band of British and French inventors and experimentalists.  And
57,10527,though this work of research and experiment was making Britain and
57,10528,"France the most rich and {362} powerful countries in the world, it"
57,10529,was not making scientific and inventive men rich and powerful.
57,10530,There is a necessary unworldliness about a sincere scientific man;
57,10531,he is too preoccupied with his research to plan and scheme how to
57,10532,make money out of it.  The economic exploitation of his
57,10533,"discoveries falls very easily and naturally, therefore, into the"
57,10534,hands of a more acquisitive type; and so we find that the crops of
57,10535,rich men which every fresh phase of scientific and technical
57,10536,"progress has produced in Great Britain, though they have not"
57,10537,displayed quite the same passionate desire to insult and kill the
57,10538,goose that laid the national golden eggs as the scholastic and
57,10539,"clerical professions, have been quite content to let that"
57,10540,profitable creature starve.  Inventors and discoverers came by
57,10541,"nature, they thought, for cleverer people to profit by."
57,10543,In this matter the Germans were a little wiser.  The German
57,10544,"""learned"" did not display the same vehement hatred of the new"
57,10545,learning.  They permitted its development.  The German business
57,10546,man and manufacturer again had not quite the same contempt for the
57,10547,"man of science as had his British competitor.  Knowledge, these"
57,10548,"Germans believed, might be a cultivated crop, responsive to"
57,10549,"fertilizers.  They did concede, therefore, a certain amount of"
57,10550,opportunity to the scientific mind; their public expenditure on
57,10551,"scientific work was relatively greater, and this expenditure was"
57,10552,abundantly rewarded.  By the latter half of the nineteenth century
57,10553,the German scientific worker had made German a necessary language
57,10554,for every science student who wished to keep abreast with the
57,10555,"latest work in his department, and in certain branches, and"
57,10556,"particularly in chemistry, Germany acquired a very great"
57,10557,superiority over her western neighbours.  The scientific effort of
57,10558,the sixties and seventies in Germany began to tell after the
57,10559,"eighties, and the German gained steadily upon Britain and France"
57,10560,in technical and industrial prosperity.
57,10562,A fresh phase in the history of invention opened when in the
57,10563,"eighties a new type of engine came into use, an engine in which"
57,10564,the expansive force of an explosive mixture replaced the expansive
57,10565,"force of steam.  The light, highly efficient engines that were"
57,10566,"thus made possible were applied to the automobile, and developed"
57,10567,at last to reach such a pitch of lightness and efficiency as to
57,10568,render flight--{363} long known to be possible--a practical
57,10569,achievement.  A successful flying machine--but not a machine large
57,10570,enough to take up a human body--was made by Professor Langley of
57,10571,the Smithsonian Institute of Washington as early as 1897.  By 1909
57,10572,the aeroplane was available for human locomotion.  There had
57,10573,seemed to be a pause in the increase of human speed with the
57,10574,"perfection of railways and automobile road traction, but with the"
57,10575,flying machine came fresh reductions in the effective distance
57,10576,between one point of the earth's surface and another.  In the
57,10577,eighteenth century the distance from London to Edinburgh was an
57,10578,eight days' journey; in 1918 the British Civil Air Transport
57,10579,"Commission reported that the journey from London to Melbourne,"
57,10580,"halfway round the earth, would probably in a few years' time be"
57,10581,accomplished in that same period of eight days.
57,10585,Too much stress must not be laid upon these striking reductions in
57,10586,the time distances of one place from another.  They are merely one
57,10587,aspect of a much profounder and more momentous enlargement of
57,10588,human possibility.  The science of agriculture and agricultural
57,10589,"chemistry, for instance, made quite parallel advances during the"
57,10590,nineteenth century.  Men learnt so to fertilize the soil as to
57,10591,produce quadruple and quintuple the crops got from the same area
57,10592,in the seventeenth century.  There was a still more extraordinary
57,10593,"advance in medical science; the average duration of life rose, the"
57,10594,"daily efficiency increased, the waste of life through ill-health"
57,10595,diminished.
57,10599,Now here altogether we have such a change in human life as to
57,10600,constitute a fresh phase of history.  In a little more than a
57,10601,century this mechanical revolution has been brought about.  In
57,10602,that time man made a stride in the material conditions of his life
57,10603,vaster than he had done during the whole long interval between the
57,10604,"palaeolithic stage and the age of cultivation, or between the days"
57,10605,of Pepi in Egypt and those of George III.  A new gigantic material
57,10606,framework for human affairs has come into existence.  Clearly it
57,10607,"demands great readjustments of our social, economical and"
57,10608,political methods.  But these readjustments have necessarily
57,10609,"waited upon the development of the mechanical revolution, and they"
57,10610,are still only in their opening stage
57,10611,to-day.
58,10623,There is a tendency in many histories to confuse together what we
58,10624,"have here called the mechanical revolution, which was an entirely"
58,10625,new thing in human experience arising out of the development of
58,10626,"organized science, a new step like the invention of agriculture or"
58,10627,"the discovery of metals, with something else, quite different in"
58,10628,"its origins, something for which there was already an historical"
58,10629,"precedent, the social and financial development which is called"
58,10630,the _industrial revolution_.  The two processes were going on
58,10631,"together, they were constantly reacting upon each other, but they"
58,10632,were in root and essence different.  There would have been an
58,10633,"industrial revolution of sorts if there had been no coal, no"
58,10634,"steam, no machinery; but in that case it would probably have"
58,10635,followed far more closely upon the lines of the social and
58,10636,financial developments of the later years of the Roman Republic.
58,10637,"It would have repeated the story of dispossessed free cultivators,"
58,10638,"gang labour, great estates, great financial fortunes, and a"
58,10639,socially destructive financial process.  Even the factory method
58,10640,came before power and machinery.  Factories were the product not
58,10641,"of machinery, but of the ""division of labour.""  Drilled and"
58,10642,sweated workers were making such things as millinery cardboard
58,10643,"boxes and furniture, and colouring maps and book illustrations and"
58,10644,"so forth, before even water-wheels had been used for industrial"
58,10645,purposes.  There were factories in Rome in the days of Augustus.
58,10646,"New books, for instance, were dictated to rows of copyists in the"
58,10647,factories of the book-sellers.  The attentive student of Defoe and
58,10648,of the political pamphlets of Fielding will realize that the idea
58,10649,of herding poor people into establishments to work collectively
58,10650,for their living was already current in Britain before the close
58,10651,of the seventeenth century.  There are intimations of it even as
58,10652,early as More's _Utopia_ (1516).  It was a social and not a
58,10653,mechanical development.
58,10657,Up to past the middle of the eighteenth century the social and
58,10658,economic history of western Europe was in fact retreading the path
58,10659,along which the Roman state had gone in the last three centuries
58,10660,"B.C.  But the political disunions of Europe, the political"
58,10661,"convulsions against monarchy, the recalcitrance of the common folk"
58,10662,and perhaps also the greater accessibility of the western European
58,10663,"intelligence to mechanical ideas and inventions, turned the"
58,10664,"process into quite novel directions.  Ideas of human solidarity,"
58,10665,"thanks to Christianity, were far more widely diffused in the newer"
58,10666,"European world, political power was not so concentrated, and the"
58,10667,"man of energy anxious to get rich turned his mind, therefore, very"
58,10668,willingly from the ideas of the slave and of gang labour to the
58,10669,idea of mechanical power and the machine.
58,10671,"The mechanical revolution, the process of mechanical invention and"
58,10672,"discovery, was a new thing in human experience and it went on"
58,10673,"regardless of the social, political, economic and industrial"
58,10674,"consequences it might produce.  The industrial revolution, on the"
58,10675,"other hand, like most other human affairs, was and is more and"
58,10676,more profoundly changed and deflected by the constant variation in
58,10677,human conditions caused by the mechanical revolution.  And the
58,10678,"essential difference between the amassing of riches, the"
58,10679,"extinction of small farmers and small business men, and the phase"
58,10680,of big finance in the latter centuries of the Roman Republic on
58,10681,"the one hand, and the very similar concentration of capital in the"
58,10682,"eighteenth and nineteenth centuries on the other, lies in the"
58,10683,profound difference in the character of labour that the mechanical
58,10684,revolution was bringing about.  The power of the old world was
58,10685,human power; everything depended ultimately upon the driving power
58,10686,"of human muscle, the muscle of ignorant and subjugated men.  A"
58,10687,"little animal muscle, supplied by draft oxen, horse traction and"
58,10688,"the like, contributed.  Where a weight had to be lifted, men"
58,10689,"lifted it; where a rock had to be quarried, men chipped it out;"
58,10690,"where a field had to be ploughed, men and oxen ploughed it; the"
58,10691,Roman equivalent of the steamship was the galley with its bank of
58,10692,sweating rowers.  A vast proportion of mankind in the early
58,10693,civilizations were employed in purely mechanical drudgery.  At its
58,10694,"onset, power-driven machinery did not seem to promise any release"
58,10695,from such unintelligent toil.  Great gangs {367} of men were
58,10696,"employed in excavating canals, in making railway cuttings and"
58,10697,"embankments, and the like.  The number of miners increased"
58,10698,enormously.  But the extension of facilities and the output of
58,10699,commodities increased much more.  And as the nineteenth century
58,10700,"went on, the plain logic of the new situation asserted itself more"
58,10701,clearly.  Human beings were no longer wanted as a source of mere
58,10702,indiscriminated power.  What could be done mechanically by a human
58,10703,being could be done faster and better by a machine.  The human
58,10704,being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to be
58,10705,exercised.  Human beings were wanted only as human beings.  The
58,10706,"_drudge_, on whom all the previous civilizations had rested, the"
58,10707,"creature of mere obedience, the man whose brains were superfluous,"
58,10708,had become unnecessary to the welfare of mankind.
58,10712,This was as true of such ancient industries as agriculture and
58,10713,mining as it was of the newest metallurgical processes.  For
58,10714,"ploughing, sowing and harvesting, swift machines came forward to"
58,10715,do the work of scores of men.  The Roman civilization was built
58,10716,upon cheap and degraded human beings; modern civilization is being
58,10717,rebuilt upon {368} cheap mechanical power.  For a hundred years
58,10718,power has been getting cheaper and labour dearer.  If for a
58,10719,"generation or so machinery has had to wait its turn in the mine,"
58,10720,it is simply because for a time men were cheaper than machinery.
58,10724,Now here was a change-over of quite primary importance in human
58,10725,affairs.  The chief solicitude of the rich and of the ruler in the
58,10726,old civilization had been to keep up a supply of drudges.  As the
58,10727,"nineteenth century went on, it became more and more plain to the"
58,10728,intelligent directive people that the common man had now to be
58,10729,something better than a drudge.  He had to be educated--if only to
58,10730,"secure ""industrial efficiency.""  He had to understand what he was"
58,10731,"about.  From the days of the first Christian propaganda, popular"
58,10732,"education had been smouldering in Europe, just as it had"
58,10733,"smouldered in Asia wherever Islam has set its foot, because of the"
58,10734,necessity of making the believer understand a little of the belief
58,10735,"by which he is {369} saved, and of enabling him to read a little"
58,10736,in the sacred books by which his belief is conveyed.  Christian
58,10737,"controversies, with their competition for adherents, ploughed the"
58,10738,"ground for the harvest of popular education.  In England, for"
58,10739,"instance, by the thirties and forties of the nineteenth century,"
58,10740,the disputes of the sects and the necessity of catching adherents
58,10741,young had produced a series of competing educational organizations
58,10742,"for children, the church ""National"" schools, the dissenting"
58,10743,"""British"" schools, and even Roman Catholic elementary schools."
58,10744,The second half of the nineteenth century was a period of rapid
58,10745,advance in popular education throughout all the Westernized world.
58,10746,There was no parallel advance in the education of the upper
58,10747,"classes--some advance, no doubt, but nothing to correspond--and so"
58,10748,the great gulf that had divided that world hitherto into the
58,10749,readers and the non-reading mass became little more than a
58,10750,slightly perceptible difference in educational level.  At the back
58,10751,"of this process was the mechanical revolution, apparently"
58,10752,"regardless of social conditions, but really insisting inexorably"
58,10753,upon the complete abolition of a totally illiterate class
58,10754,throughout the world.
58,10756,The economic revolution of the Roman Republic had never been
58,10757,clearly apprehended by the common people of Rome.  The ordinary
58,10758,"Roman citizen never saw the changes through which he lived,"
58,10759,clearly and comprehensively as we see them.  But the industrial
58,10760,"revolution, as it went on towards the end of the nineteenth"
58,10761,"century, was more and more distinctly _seen_ as one whole process"
58,10762,"by the common people it was affecting, because presently they"
58,10763,"could read and discuss and communicate, and because they went"
58,10764,about and saw things as no commonalty had ever done before.
59,10776,The institutions and customs and political ideas of the ancient
59,10777,"civilizations grew up slowly, age by age, no man designing and no"
59,10778,man foreseeing.  It was only in that great century of human
59,10779,"adolescence, the sixth century B.C., that men began to think"
59,10780,"clearly about their relations to one another, and first to"
59,10781,question and first propose to alter and rearrange the established
59,10782,beliefs and laws and methods of human government.
59,10784,We have told of the glorious intellectual dawn of Greece and
59,10785,"Alexandria, and how presently the collapse of the slave-holding"
59,10786,civilizations and the clouds of religious intolerance and
59,10787,absolutist government darkened the promise of that beginning.  The
59,10788,light of fearless thinking did not break through the European
59,10789,obscurity again effectually until the fifteenth and sixteenth
59,10790,centuries.  We have tried to show something of the share of the
59,10791,great winds of Arab curiosity and Mongol conquest in this gradual
59,10792,clearing of the mental skies of Europe.  And at first it was
59,10793,chiefly material knowledge that increased.  The first fruits of
59,10794,the recovered manhood of the race were material achievements and
59,10795,"material power.  The science of human relationship, of individual"
59,10796,"and social psychology, of education and of economics, are not only"
59,10797,more subtle and intricate in themselves but also bound up
59,10798,inextricably with much emotional matter.  The advances made in
59,10799,them have been slower and made against greater opposition.  Men
59,10800,will listen dispassionately to the most diverse suggestions about
59,10801,"stars or molecules, but ideas about our ways of life touch and"
59,10802,reflect upon everyone about us.
59,10804,And just as in Greece the bold speculations of Plato came before
59,10805,"Aristotle's hard search for fact, so in Europe the first political"
59,10806,"enquiries of the new phase were put in the form of ""Utopian"""
59,10807,"stories, directly imitated from Plato's _Republic_ and his _Laws_."
59,10808,Sir Thomas {371} More's _Utopia_ is a curious imitation of Plato
59,10809,that bore fruit in a new English poor law.  The Neapolitan
59,10810,Campanella's _City of the Sun_ was more fantastic and less
59,10811,fruitful.
59,10813,By the end of the seventeenth century we find a considerable and
59,10814,growing literature of political and social science was being
59,10815,"produced.  Among the pioneers in this discussion was John Locke,"
59,10816,"the son of an English republican, an Oxford scholar who first"
59,10817,directed his attention to chemistry and medicine.  His treatises
59,10818,"on government, toleration and education show a mind fully awake to"
59,10819,the possibilities of social reconstruction.  Parallel with and a
59,10820,"little later than John Locke in England, Montesquieu"
59,10821,"(1689-1755) in France subjected social, political and religious"
59,10822,institutions to a searching and fundamental analysis.  He stripped
59,10823,the magical prestige from the absolutist monarchy in France.  He
59,10824,shares with Locke the credit for clearing away many of the false
59,10825,ideas that had hitherto prevented deliberate and conscious
59,10826,attempts to reconstruct human society.
59,10828,The generation that followed him in the middle and later decades
59,10829,of the eighteenth century was boldly speculative upon the moral
59,10830,and intellectual clearings he had made.  A group of brilliant
59,10831,"writers, the ""Encyclopaedists,"" mostly rebel spirits from the"
59,10832,"excellent schools of the Jesuits, set themselves to scheme out a"
59,10833,new world (1766).  Side by side with the Encyclopaedists were the
59,10834,"Economists or Physiocrats, who were making bold and crude"
59,10835,enquiries into the production and distribution of food and goods.
59,10836,"Morelly, the author of the _Code de La Nature_, denounced the"
59,10837,institution of private property and proposed a communistic
59,10838,organization of society.  He was the precursor of that large and
59,10839,various school of collectivist thinkers in the nineteenth century
59,10840,who are lumped together as Socialists.
59,10842,What is Socialism?  There are a hundred definitions of Socialism
59,10843,and a thousand sects of Socialists.  Essentially Socialism is no
59,10844,more and no less than a criticism of the idea of property in the
59,10845,light of the public good.  We may review the history of that idea
59,10846,through the ages very briefly.  That and the idea of
59,10847,internationalism are the two cardinal ideas upon which most of our
59,10848,political life is turning.
59,10854,The idea of property arises out of the combative instincts of the
59,10855,"species.  Long before men were men, the ancestral ape was a"
59,10856,proprietor.  Primitive property is what a beast will fight for.
59,10857,"The dog and his bone, the tigress and her lair, the roaring stag"
59,10858,"and his herd, these are proprietorship blazing.  No more"
59,10859,nonsensical expression is conceivable in sociology than the term
59,10860,"""primitive communism.""  The Old Man of the family tribe of early"
59,10861,palaeolithic times insisted {373} upon his proprietorship in his
59,10862,"wives and daughters, in his tools, in his visible universe.  If"
59,10863,"any other man wandered into his visible universe he fought him,"
59,10864,and if he could he slew him.  The tribe grew in the course of
59,10865,"ages, as Atkinson showed convincingly in his _Primal Law_, by the"
59,10866,gradual toleration by the Old Man of the existence of the younger
59,10867,"men, and of their proprietorship in the wives they captured from"
59,10868,"outside the tribe, and in the tools and ornaments they made and"
59,10869,the game they slew.  Human society grew by a compromise between
59,10870,this one's property and that.  It was a compromise with instinct
59,10871,which was forced upon men by the necessity of driving some other
59,10872,tribe out of its visible universe.  If the hills and forests and
59,10873,"streams were not _your_ land or _my_ land, it was because they had"
59,10874,to be our land.  Each of us would have preferred to have it _my_
59,10875,"land, but that would not work.  In that case the other fellows"
59,10876,"would have destroyed us.  Society, therefore, is from its"
59,10877,beginning a _mitigation of ownership_.  Ownership in the beast and
59,10878,in the primitive savage was far more intense a thing than it is in
59,10879,the civilized world to-day.  It is rooted more strongly in our
59,10880,instincts than in our reason.
59,10882,In the natural savage and in the untutored man to-day there is no
59,10883,limitation to the sphere of ownership.  Whatever you can fight
59,10884,"for, you can own; women-folk, spared captive, captured beast,"
59,10885,"forest glade, stone-pit or what not.  As the community grew, a"
59,10886,"sort of law came to restrain internecine fighting, men developed"
59,10887,rough-and-ready methods of settling proprietorship.  Men could own
59,10888,what they were the first to make or capture or claim.  It seemed
59,10889,natural that a debtor who could not pay should become the property
59,10890,of his creditor.  Equally natural was it that after claiming a
59,10891,patch of land a man should exact payments from anyone who wanted
59,10892,"to use it.  It was only slowly, as the possibilities of organized"
59,10893,"life dawned on men, that this unlimited property in anything"
59,10894,whatever began to be recognized as a nuisance.  Men found
59,10895,"themselves born into a universe all owned and claimed, nay! they"
59,10896,found themselves born owned and claimed.  The social struggles of
59,10897,"the earlier civilization are difficult to trace now, but the"
59,10898,history we have told of the Roman Republic shows a community
59,10899,waking up to the idea that debts may become a public inconvenience
59,10900,"and should then be repudiated, and that the unlimited ownership of"
59,10901,land is also an inconvenience.  We {374} find that later Babylonia
59,10902,"severely limited the rights of property in slaves.  Finally, we"
59,10903,"find in the teaching of that great revolutionist, Jesus of"
59,10904,"Nazareth, such an attack upon property as had never been before."
59,10905,"Easier it was, he said, for a camel to go through the eye of a"
59,10906,needle than for the owner of great possessions to enter the
59,10907,"kingdom of heaven.  A steady, continuous criticism of the"
59,10908,permissible scope of property seems to have been going on in the
59,10909,world for the last twenty-five or thirty centuries.  Nineteen
59,10910,hundred years after Jesus of Nazareth we find all the world that
59,10911,has come under the Christian teaching persuaded that there could
59,10912,be no property in human beings.  And also the idea that a man may
59,10913,"""do what he likes with his own"" was very much shaken in relation"
59,10914,to other sorts of property.
59,10916,But this world of the closing eighteenth century was still only in
59,10917,the interrogative stage in this matter.  It had got nothing clear
59,10918,"enough, much less settled enough, to act upon.  One of its primary"
59,10919,impulses was to protect property against the greed and waste of
59,10920,kings and the exploitation of noble adventurers.  It was largely
59,10921,to protect private property from taxation that the French
59,10922,Revolution began.  But the equalitarian formulae of the Revolution
59,10923,carried it into a criticism of the very property it had risen to
59,10924,protect.  How can men be free and equal when numbers of them have
59,10925,"no ground to stand upon and nothing to eat, and the owners will"
59,10926,neither feed nor lodge them unless they toil?  Excessively--the
59,10927,poor complained.
59,10929,To which riddle the reply of one important political group was to
59,10930,"set about ""dividing up.""  They wanted to intensify and"
59,10931,"universalize property.  Aiming at the same end by another route,"
59,10932,"there were the primitive socialists--or, to be more exact,"
59,10933,"communists--who wanted to ""abolish"" private property altogether."
59,10934,The state (a democratic state was of course understood) was to own
59,10935,all property.
59,10937,It is paradoxical that different men seeking the same ends of
59,10938,liberty and happiness should propose on the one hand to make
59,10939,"property as absolute as possible, and on the other to put an end"
59,10940,to it altogether.  But so it was.  And the clue to this paradox is
59,10941,to be found in the fact that ownership is not one thing but a
59,10942,multitude of different things.
59,10946,It was only as the nineteenth century developed that men began to
59,10947,"realize that property was not one simple thing, but a great"
59,10948,"complex of ownerships of different values and consequences, that"
59,10949,"many things (such as one's body, the implements of an artist,"
59,10950,"clothing, toothbrushes) are very profoundly and incurably one's"
59,10951,"personal property, and that there is a very great range of things,"
59,10952,"railways, machinery of various sorts, homes, cultivated gardens,"
59,10953,"pleasure boats, for example, which need each to be considered very"
59,10954,particularly to determine how far and under what limitations it
59,10955,"may come under private ownership, and how far it falls into the"
59,10956,public domain and may be administered and let out by the state in
59,10957,the collective interest.  On the practical side these questions
59,10958,"pass into politics, and the problem of making and sustaining"
59,10959,efficient state administration.  They open up issues in social
59,10960,"psychology, and interact with the enquiries of educational"
59,10961,science.  The criticism of property is still a vast and passionate
59,10962,ferment rather than a science.  On the one hand are the
59,10963,"Individualists, who would protect and enlarge our present freedoms"
59,10964,"with what we possess, and on the other the Socialists who would in"
59,10965,many directions pool our ownerships and restrain our proprietory
59,10966,acts.  In practice one will find every gradation between the
59,10967,"extreme individualist, who will scarcely tolerate a tax of any"
59,10968,"sort to support a government, and the communist who would deny any"
59,10969,possessions at all.  The ordinary socialist of
59,10970,to-day is what is called a collectivist; he would allow a
59,10971,considerable amount of private property but put such affairs as
59,10972,"education, transport, mines, land-owning, most mass productions of"
59,10973,"staple articles, and the like, into the hands of a highly"
59,10974,organized state.  Nowadays there does seem to be a gradual
59,10975,convergence of reasonable men towards a moderate socialism
59,10976,scientifically studied and planned.  It is realized more and more
59,10977,clearly that the untutored man does not co-operate easily and
59,10978,"successfully in large undertakings, and that every step towards a"
59,10979,more complex state and every function that the state takes over
59,10980,"from private enterprise, necessitates a corresponding educational"
59,10981,advance and the organization of a proper criticism and control.
59,10982,Both the press and the political methods of the contemporary state
59,10983,are far too crude for any large extension of collective
59,10984,activities.
59,10986,But for a time the stresses between employer and employed and
59,10987,{376} particularly between selfish employers and reluctant
59,10988,"workers, led to a world-wide dissemination of the very harsh and"
59,10989,elementary form of communism which is associated with the name of
59,10990,Marx.  Marx based his theories on a belief that men's minds are
59,10991,"limited by their economic necessities, and that there is a"
59,10992,necessary conflict of interests in our present civilization
59,10993,between the prosperous and employing classes of people and the
59,10994,employed mass.  With the advance in education necessitated by the
59,10995,"mechanical revolution, this great employed majority will become"
59,10996,more and more class-conscious and more and more solid in
59,10997,antagonism to the (class-conscious) ruling minority.  In some way
59,10998,"the class-conscious workers would seize power, he prophesied, and"
59,10999,"inaugurate a new social state.  The antagonism, the insurrection,"
59,11000,"the possible revolution are understandable enough, but it does not"
59,11001,follow that a new social state or anything but a socially
59,11002,"destructive process will ensue.  Put to the test in Russia,"
59,11003,"Marxism, as we shall note later, has proved singularly uncreative."
59,11009,Marx sought to replace national antagonism by class antagonisms;
59,11010,"Marxism has produced in succession a First, a Second and a Third"
59,11011,Workers' International.  But from the starting point of modern
59,11012,individualistic thought it is also possible to reach international
59,11013,"ideas.  From the days of that great English economist, Adam Smith,"
59,11014,onward there has been an increasing realization that for
59,11015,world-wide prosperity free and unencumbered trade about the earth
59,11016,is needed.  The individualist with his hostility to the state is
59,11017,hostile also to tariffs and boundaries and all the restraints upon
59,11018,free act and movement that national boundaries seem to justify.
59,11019,"It is interesting to see two lines of thought, so diverse in"
59,11020,"spirit, so different in substance as this class-war socialism of"
59,11021,the Marxists and the individualistic free-trading philosophy of
59,11022,"the British business men of the Victorian age heading at last, in"
59,11023,"spite of these primary differences, towards the same intimations"
59,11024,of a new world-wide treatment of human affairs outside the
59,11025,boundaries and limitations of any existing state.  The logic of
59,11026,reality triumphs over the logic of theory.  We begin to perceive
59,11027,that from widely divergent starting points individualist theory
59,11028,"and socialist theory are part of a common search, a search for"
59,11029,"more spacious social and political ideas and interpretations, upon"
59,11030,"which men may contrive to work together, a search that began again"
59,11031,in Europe and has intensified as men's confidence in the ideas of
59,11032,"the Holy Roman Empire and in Christendom decayed, and as the age"
59,11033,of discovery broadened their horizons from the world of the
59,11034,Mediterranean to the whole wide world.
59,11036,To bring this description of the elaboration and development of
59,11037,"social, economic and political ideas right down to the discussions"
59,11038,"of the present day, would be to introduce issues altogether too"
59,11039,controversial for the scope and intentions of this book.  But
59,11040,"regarding these things, as we do here, from the vast perspectives"
59,11041,"of the student of world history, we are bound to recognize that"
59,11042,this reconstruction of these directive ideas in the human mind is
59,11043,still an unfinished task--we cannot even estimate yet how
59,11044,unfinished the task may be.  Certain common beliefs do seem to be
59,11045,"emerging, and their influence is very perceptible upon the"
59,11046,political events and public acts of to-day; but at present they
59,11047,are not clear enough nor convincing enough to compel men
59,11048,definitely and systematically towards their realization.  {378}
59,11049,"Men's acts waver between tradition and the new, and on the whole"
59,11050,"they rather gravitate towards the traditional.  Yet, compared with"
59,11051,"the thought of even a brief lifetime ago, there does seem to be an"
59,11052,outline shaping itself of a new order in human affairs.  It is a
59,11053,"sketchy outline, vanishing into vagueness at this point and that,"
59,11054,"{379} and fluctuating in detail and formulae, yet it grows"
59,11055,"steadfastly clearer, and its main lines change less and less."
59,11059,It is becoming plainer and plainer each year that in many respects
59,11060,"and in an increasing range of affairs, mankind is becoming one"
59,11061,"community, and that it is more and more necessary that in such"
59,11062,"matters there should be a common world-wide control.  For example,"
59,11063,it is steadily truer that the whole planet is now one economic
59,11064,"community, that the proper exploitation of its natural resources"
59,11065,"demands one comprehensive direction, and that the greater power"
59,11066,and range that discovery has given human effort makes the present
59,11067,fragmentary and contentious administration of such affairs more
59,11068,and more wasteful and dangerous.  Financial and monetary
59,11069,expedients also become world-wide interests to be dealt with
59,11070,successfully only on world-wide lines.  Infectious diseases and
59,11071,the increase and migrations of population are also now plainly
59,11072,seen to be world-wide concerns.  The greater power and range of
59,11073,human activities has also made war disproportionately destructive
59,11074,"and disorganizing, and, even as a clumsy way of settling issues"
59,11075,"between government and government and people and people,"
59,11076,ineffective.  All these things clamour for controls and
59,11077,authorities of a greater range and greater comprehensiveness than
59,11078,any government that has hitherto existed.
59,11080,But it does not follow that the solution of these problems lies in
59,11081,some super-government of all the world arising by conquest or by
59,11082,the coalescence of existing governments.  By analogy with existing
59,11083,"institutions men have thought of the Parliament of Mankind, of a"
59,11084,"World Congress, of a President or Emperor of the Earth.  Our first"
59,11085,"natural reaction is towards some such conclusion, but the"
59,11086,discussion and experiences of half a century of suggestions and
59,11087,attempts has on the whole discouraged belief in that first obvious
59,11088,idea.  Along that line to world unity the resistances are too
59,11089,great.  The drift of thought seems now to be in the direction of a
59,11090,"number of special committees or organizations, with world-wide"
59,11091,power delegated to them by existing governments in this group of
59,11092,"matters or that, bodies concerned with the waste or development of"
59,11093,"natural wealth, with the equalization of labour conditions, with"
59,11094,"world peace, with currency, population and health, and so forth."
59,11098,The world may discover that all its common interests are being
59,11099,"managed as one concern, while it still fails to realize that a"
59,11100,world government exists.  But before even so much human unity is
59,11101,"attained, before such international arrangements can be put above"
59,11102,"patriotic suspicions and jealousies, it is necessary that the"
59,11103,common mind of the race should be possessed of that idea of human
59,11104,"unity, and that the idea of mankind as one family should be a"
59,11105,matter of universal instruction and understanding.
59,11107,For a score of centuries or more the spirit of the great universal
59,11108,religions has been struggling to maintain and extend that idea of
59,11109,"a universal human brotherhood, but to this day the spites, angers"
59,11110,"and distrusts of tribal, national and racial friction obstruct,"
59,11111,"and successfully obstruct, the broader views and more generous"
59,11112,impulses which would make every man the servant of all mankind.
59,11113,The idea of human brotherhood struggles now to possess the human
59,11114,"soul, just as the idea of Christendom struggled to possess the"
59,11115,soul of Europe in the confusion and disorder of the sixth and
59,11116,seventh centuries of the Christian era.  The dissemination and
59,11117,triumph of such ideas must be the work of a multitude of devoted
59,11118,"and undistinguished missionaries, and no contemporary writer can"
59,11119,presume to guess how far such work has gone or what harvest it may
59,11120,be preparing.
59,11122,Social and economic questions seem to be inseparably mingled with
59,11123,international ones.  The solution in each case lies in an appeal
59,11124,to that same spirit of service which can enter and inspire the
59,11125,"human heart.  The distrust, intractability and egotism of nations"
59,11126,"reflects and is reflected by the distrust, intractability and"
59,11127,egotism of the individual owner and worker in the face of the
59,11128,common good.  Exaggerations of possessiveness in the individual
59,11129,are parallel and of a piece with the clutching greed of nations
59,11130,and emperors.  They are products of the same instinctive
59,11131,"tendencies, and the same ignorances and traditions."
59,11132,Internationalism is the socialism of nations.  No one who has
59,11133,wrestled with these problems can feel that there yet exists a
59,11134,sufficient depth and strength of psychological science and a
59,11135,sufficiently planned-out educational method and organization for
59,11136,any real and final solution of these riddles of human intercourse
59,11137,and cooperation.  We are as incapable of planning a really
59,11138,effective peace organization of the world to-day as were men in
59,11139,"1820 to plan an {381} electric railway system, but for all we know"
59,11140,the thing is equally practicable and may be as nearly at hand.
59,11142,"No man can go beyond his own knowledge, no thought can reach"
59,11143,"beyond contemporary thought, and it is impossible for us to guess"
59,11144,or foretell how many generations of humanity may have to live in
59,11145,war and waste and insecurity and misery before the dawn of the
59,11146,"great peace to which all history seems to be pointing, peace in"
59,11147,"the heart and peace in the world, ends our night of wasteful and"
59,11148,aimless living.  Our proposed solutions are still vague and crude.
59,11149,Passion and suspicion surround them.  A great task of intellectual
59,11150,"reconstruction is going on, it is still incomplete, and our"
59,11151,"conceptions grow clearer and more exact--slowly, rapidly, it is"
59,11152,hard to tell which.  But as they grow clearer they will gather
59,11153,power over the minds and imaginations of men.  Their present lack
59,11154,of grip is due to their lack of assurance and exact rightness.
59,11155,They are misunderstood because they are variously and confusingly
59,11156,presented.  But with precision and certainty the new vision of the
59,11157,world will gain compelling power.  It may presently gain power
59,11158,very rapidly.  And a great work of educational reconstruction will
59,11159,follow logically and necessarily upon that clearer understanding.
60,11171,The region of the world that displayed the most immediate and
60,11172,striking results from the new inventions in transport was North
60,11173,"America.  Politically the United States embodied, and its"
60,11174,"constitution crystallized, the liberal ideas of the middle"
60,11175,"eighteenth century.  It dispensed with state-church or crown, it"
60,11176,"would have no titles, it protected property very jealously as a"
60,11177,"method of freedom, and--the exact practice varied at first in the"
60,11178,different states--it gave nearly every adult male citizen a vote.
60,11179,"Its method of voting was barbarically crude, and as a consequence"
60,11180,its political life fell very soon under the control of highly
60,11181,"organized party machines, but that did not prevent the newly"
60,11182,"emancipated population developing an energy, enterprise and public"
60,11183,spirit far beyond that of any other contemporary population.
60,11185,Then came that acceleration of locomotion to which we have already
60,11186,"called attention.  It is a curious thing that America, which owes"
60,11187,"most to this acceleration in locomotion, has felt it least.  The"
60,11188,"United States have taken the railway, the river steamboat, the"
60,11189,telegraph and so forth as though they were a natural part of their
60,11190,growth.  They were not.  These things happened to come along just
60,11191,in time to save American unity.  The United States of to-day were
60,11192,"made first by the river steamboat, and then by the railway."
60,11193,"Without these things, the present United States, this vast"
60,11194,"continental nation, would have been altogether impossible.  The"
60,11195,westward flow of population would have been far more sluggish.  It
60,11196,might never have crossed the great central plains.  It took nearly
60,11197,two hundred years for effective settlement to reach from the coast
60,11198,"to Missouri, much less than halfway across the continent.  The"
60,11199,first state established beyond the river was the steamboat state
60,11200,of Missouri in 1821.  But the rest of the distance to the Pacific
60,11201,was done in a few decades.
60,11205,If we had the resources of the cinema it would be interesting to
60,11206,"show a map of North America year by year from 1600 onward, with"
60,11207,"little dots to represent hundreds of people, each dot a hundred,"
60,11208,and stars to represent cities of a hundred thousand people.
60,11210,For two hundred years the reader would see that stippling creeping
60,11211,"slowly along the coastal districts and navigable waters, spreading"
60,11212,"still more gradually into Indiana, Kentucky and so forth.  Then"
60,11213,somewhere about 1810 would come a change.  Things would get more
60,11214,lively along the river courses.  The dots would be multiplying and
60,11215,spreading.  That would be the steamboat.  The pioneer dots would
60,11216,be spreading soon over Kansas and Nebraska from a number of
60,11217,jumping-off places along the great rivers.
60,11219,Then from about 1850 onward would come the black lines of the
60,11220,"railways, and after that the little black dots would not simply"
60,11221,"creep but run.  They would appear now so rapidly, it would be"
60,11222,almost as though they were being put on by some sort of spraying
60,11223,machine.  And suddenly here and then there would appear the first
60,11224,stars to indicate the first great cities of a hundred thousand
60,11225,people.  First one or two and then a multitude of cities--each
60,11226,like a knot in the growing net of the railways.
60,11228,The growth of the United States is a process that has no precedent
60,11229,in the world's history; it is a new kind of occurrence.  Such a
60,11230,"community could not have come into existence before, and if it"
60,11231,"had, without railways it would certainly have dropped to pieces"
60,11232,long before now.  Without railways or telegraph it would be far
60,11233,easier to administer California from Pekin than from Washington.
60,11234,But this great population of the United States of America has not
60,11235,"only grown outrageously; it has kept uniform.  Nay, it has become"
60,11236,more uniform.  The man of San Francisco is more like the man of
60,11237,New York to-day than the man of Virginia was like the man of New
60,11238,England a century ago.  And the process of assimilation goes on
60,11239,"unimpeded.  The United States is being woven by railway, by"
60,11240,"telegraph, more and more into one vast unity, speaking, thinking"
60,11241,and acting harmoniously with itself.  Soon aviation will be
60,11242,helping in the work.
60,11244,This great community of the United States is an altogether new
60,11245,thing in history.  There have been great empires before with
60,11246,"populations exceeding 100 millions, but these were associations of"
60,11247,divergent {384} peoples; there has never been one single people on
60,11248,this scale before.  We want a new term for this new thing.  We
60,11249,call the United States a country just as we call France or Holland
60,11250,a country.  But the two things are as different as an automobile
60,11251,and a one-horse shay.  They are the creations of different periods
60,11252,and different conditions; they are going to work at a different
60,11253,pace and in an entirely different way.  The United States in scale
60,11254,and possibility is halfway between a European state and a United
60,11255,States of all the world.
60,11257,But on the way to this present greatness and security the American
60,11258,people passed through one phase of dire conflict.  The river
60,11259,"steamboats, the railways, the telegraph, and their associate"
60,11260,"facilities, did not come soon enough to avert a deepening conflict"
60,11261,of interests and ideas between the southern and northern states of
60,11262,"the Union.  The former were slave-holding states; the latter,"
60,11263,states in which all men were free.  The railways and steamboats at
60,11264,first did but bring into sharper conflict an already established
60,11265,difference between the two sections of the United States.  The
60,11266,increasing unification due to the new means of transport made the
60,11267,question whether the southern spirit or the northern should
60,11268,prevail an ever more urgent one.  There was little possibility of
60,11269,compromise.  The northern spirit was free and individualistic; the
60,11270,southern made for great estates and a conscious gentility ruling
60,11271,over a dusky subject multitude.
60,11273,Every new territory that was organized into a state as the tide of
60,11274,"population swept westward, every new incorporation into the fast"
60,11275,"growing American system, became a field of conflict between the"
60,11276,"two ideas, whether it should become a state of free citizens, or"
60,11277,whether the estate and slavery system should prevail.  From 1833
60,11278,an American anti-slavery society was not merely resisting the
60,11279,extension of the institution but agitating the whole country for
60,11280,its complete abolition.  The issue flamed up into open conflict
60,11281,over the admission of Texas to the Union.  Texas had originally
60,11282,"been a part of the republic of Mexico, but it was largely"
60,11283,"colonized by Americans from the slave-holding states, and it"
60,11284,"seceded from Mexico, established its independence in 1835, and was"
60,11285,annexed to the United States in 1844.  Under the Mexican law
60,11286,"slavery had been forbidden in Texas, but now the South claimed"
60,11287,Texas for slavery and got it.
60,11291,Meanwhile the development of ocean navigation was bringing a
60,11292,growing swarm of immigrants from Europe to swell the spreading
60,11293,"population of the northern states, and the raising of Iowa,"
60,11294,"Wisconsin, Minnesota and Oregon, all northern farm lands, to state"
60,11295,"level, gave the anti-slavery North the possibility of predominance"
60,11296,both in the Senate and the House of Representatives.  The
60,11297,"cotton-growing South, irritated by the growing threat of the"
60,11298,"Abolitionist movement, and fearing this predominance in Congress,"
60,11299,began to talk of secession from the Union.  Southerners began to
60,11300,dream of annexations to the south of them in Mexico and the West
60,11301,"Indies, and of great slave state, detached from the North and"
60,11302,reaching to Panama.
60,11306,The return of Abraham Lincoln as an anti-extension President in
60,11307,1860 decided the South to split the Union.  South Carolina passed
60,11308,"an ""ordinance of secession"" and prepared for war.  Mississippi,"
60,11309,"Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas joined her, and a"
60,11310,"convention met at Montgomery in Alabama, elected Jefferson Davis"
60,11311,"president of the ""Confederated States"" of America, and adopted a"
60,11312,"constitution specifically upholding ""the institution of negro"
60,11313,"slavery."""
60,11317,"Abraham Lincoln was, it chanced, a man entirely typical of the new"
60,11318,people that had grown up after the War of Independence.  His early
60,11319,years had been spent as a drifting particle in the general
60,11320,"westward flow of the population.  He was born in Kentucky (1809),"
60,11321,was taken to Indiana as a boy and later on to Illinois.  Life was
60,11322,rough in the backwoods of Indiana in those days; the house was a
60,11323,"mere log cabin in the wilderness, and his schooling was poor and"
60,11324,"casual.  But his mother taught him to read early, and he became a"
60,11325,"voracious reader.  At seventeen he was a big athletic youth, a"
60,11326,great wrestler and runner.  He worked for a time as clerk in a
60,11327,"store, went into business as a storekeeper with a drunken partner,"
60,11328,and contracted debts that he did not fully pay off for fifteen
60,11329,"years.  In 1834, when he was still only five and twenty, he was"
60,11330,elected member of the House of Representatives for the State of
60,11331,Illinois.  In Illinois particularly the question of slavery flamed
60,11332,because the great leader of the party for the extension of slavery
60,11333,in the national Congress was Senator Douglas of Illinois.  Douglas
60,11334,"was a man of great ability and prestige, and for some years"
60,11335,"Lincoln fought against him by speech and pamphlet, rising steadily"
60,11336,to the position of his most formidable and finally victorious
60,11337,antagonist.  Their culminating struggle was the presidential
60,11338,"campaign of 1860, and on the fourth of March, 1861, Lincoln was"
60,11339,"inaugurated President, with the southern states already in active"
60,11340,"secession from the rule of the federal government at Washington,"
60,11341,and committing acts of war.
60,11343,This civil war in America was fought by improvised armies that
60,11344,grew steadily from a few score thousands to hundreds of
60,11345,thousands--until at last the Federal forces exceeded a million
60,11346,men; it was fought over a vast area between New Mexico and the
60,11347,"eastern sea, Washington and Richmond were the chief objectives."
60,11348,It is beyond our scope here to tell of the mounting energy of
60,11349,that epic struggle that rolled to and fro across the hills and
60,11350,woods of Tennessee and Virginia and down the Mississippi.  There
60,11351,was a terrible waste and killing of men.  Thrust was followed by
60,11352,"counter thrust; hope gave way to despondency, and returned and was"
60,11353,again disappointed.  Sometimes Washington seemed within the
60,11354,Confederate grasp; again the Federal armies were driving towards
60,11355,"Richmond.  The Confederates, outnumbered and far poorer in"
60,11356,"resources, fought under {387} a general of supreme ability,"
60,11357,General Lee.  The generalship of the Union was far inferior.
60,11358,"Generals were dismissed, new generals appointed; until at last,"
60,11359,"under Sherman and Grant, came victory over the ragged and"
60,11360,"depleted South.  In October, 1864, a Federal army under Sherman"
60,11361,broke through the Confederate left and marched down from Tennessee
60,11362,"through Georgia to the coast, right across the Confederate"
60,11363,"country, and then turned up through the {388} Carolinas, coming in"
60,11364,upon the rear of the Confederate armies.  Meanwhile Grant held Lee
60,11365,"before Richmond until Sherman closed on him.  On April 9th, 1865,"
60,11366,"Lee and his army surrendered at Appomattox Court House, and within"
60,11367,a month all the remaining secessionist armies had laid down their
60,11368,arms and the Confederacy was at an end.
60,11372,This four years' struggle had meant an enormous physical and moral
60,11373,strain for the people of the United States.  The principle of
60,11374,"state autonomy was very dear to many minds, and the North seemed"
60,11375,in effect to be forcing abolition upon the South.  In the border
60,11376,"states brothers and cousins, even fathers and sons, would take"
60,11377,opposite sides and find themselves in antagonistic armies.  The
60,11378,"North felt its cause a righteous one, but for great numbers of"
60,11379,people it was not a full-bodied and unchallenged righteousness.
60,11380,But for Lincoln there was no doubt.  He was a clear-minded man in
60,11381,the midst of much confusion.  He stood for union; he stood for the
60,11382,"wide peace of America.  He was opposed to slavery, but slavery he"
60,11383,held to be a secondary issue; his primary purpose was that the
60,11384,United States should not be torn into two contrasted and jarring
60,11385,fragments.
60,11387,When in the opening stages of the war Congress and the Federal
60,11388,"generals embarked upon a precipitate emancipation, Lincoln opposed"
60,11389,and mitigated their enthusiasm.  He was for emancipation by stages
60,11390,"and with compensation.  It was only in January, 1865, that the"
60,11391,situation had ripened to a point when Congress could propose to
60,11392,"abolish slavery for ever by a constitutional amendment, and the"
60,11393,war was already over before this amendment was ratified by the
60,11394,states.
60,11396,"As the war dragged on through 1862 and 1863, the first passions"
60,11397,"and enthusiasms waned, and America learnt all the phases of war"
60,11398,weariness and war disgust.  The President found himself with
60,11399,"defeatists, traitors, dismissed generals, tortuous party"
60,11400,"politicians, and a doubting and fatigued people behind him and"
60,11401,uninspired generals and depressed troops before him; his chief
60,11402,consolation must have been that Jefferson Davis at Richmond could
60,11403,"be in little better case.  The English government misbehaved, and"
60,11404,permitted the Confederate agents in England to launch and man
60,11405,three swift privateer ships--the _Alabama_ is the best remembered
60,11406,of them--which {389} chased United States shipping from the seas.
60,11407,The French army in Mexico was trampling the Monroe Doctrine in the
60,11408,"dirt.  Came subtle proposals from Richmond to drop the war, leave"
60,11409,"the issues of the war for subsequent discussion, and turn, Federal"
60,11410,"and Confederate in alliance, upon the French in Mexico.  But"
60,11411,Lincoln would not listen to such proposals unless the supremacy of
60,11412,the Union was maintained.  The Americans might do such things as
60,11413,one people but not as two.
60,11415,He held the United States together through long weary months of
60,11416,"reverses and ineffective effort, through black phases of division"
60,11417,and failing courage; and there is no record that he ever faltered
60,11418,from his purpose.  There were times when there was nothing to be
60,11419,"done, when he sat in the White House silent and motionless, a grim"
60,11420,monument of resolve; times when he relaxed his mind by jesting and
60,11421,broad anecdotes.
60,11423,He saw the Union triumphant.  He entered Richmond the day after
60,11424,"its surrender, and heard of Lee's capitulation.  He returned to"
60,11425,"Washington, and on April 11th made his last public address.  His"
60,11426,theme was reconciliation and the reconstruction of loyal
60,11427,government in the defeated states.  On the evening of April 14th
60,11428,"he went to Ford's theatre in Washington, and as he sat looking at"
60,11429,"the stage, he was shot in the back of the head and killed by an"
60,11430,"actor named Booth who had some sort of grievance against him, and"
60,11431,who had crept into the box unobserved.  But Lincoln's work was
60,11432,done; the Union was saved.
60,11434,At the beginning of the war there was no railway to the Pacific
60,11435,coast; after it the railways spread like a swiftly growing plant
60,11436,until now they have clutched and held and woven all the vast
60,11437,territory of the United States into one indissoluble mental and
60,11438,material unity--the greatest real community--until the common folk
60,11439,of China have learnt to read--in the world.
61,11451,We have told how after the convulsion of the French Revolution and
61,11452,"the Napoleonic adventure, Europe settled down again for a time to"
61,11453,an insecure peace and a sort of modernized revival of the
61,11454,political conditions of fifty years before.  Until the middle of
61,11455,the century the new facilities in the handling of steel and the
61,11456,railway and steamship produced no marked political consequences.
61,11457,But the social tension due to the development of urban
61,11458,industrialism grew.  France remained a conspicuously uneasy
61,11459,country.  The revolution of 1830 was followed by another in 1848.
61,11460,"Then Napoleon III, a nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, became first"
61,11461,"President, and then (in 1852) Emperor."
61,11463,"He set about rebuilding Paris, and changed it from a picturesque"
61,11464,seventeenth century insanitary city into the spacious Latinized
61,11465,"city of marble it is to-day.  He set about rebuilding France, and"
61,11466,made it into a brilliant-looking modernized imperialism.  He
61,11467,displayed a disposition to revive that competitiveness of the
61,11468,Great Powers which had kept Europe busy with futile wars during
61,11469,the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  The Tsar Nicholas I of
61,11470,Russia (1825-1856) was also becoming aggressive and pressing
61,11471,southward upon the Turkish Empire with his eyes on Constantinople.
61,11473,After the turn of the century Europe broke out into a fresh cycle
61,11474,"of wars.  They were chiefly ""balance-of-power"" and ascendancy"
61,11475,"wars.  England, France and Sardinia assailed Russia in the Crimean"
61,11476,war in defence of Turkey; Prussia (with Italy as an ally) and
61,11477,"Austria fought for the leadership of Germany, France liberated"
61,11478,"North Italy from Austria at the price of Savoy, and Italy"
61,11479,gradually unified itself into one kingdom.  Then Napoleon III was
61,11480,"so ill advised as to attempt adventures in Mexico, during the"
61,11481,American Civil War; he set up an Emperor Maximilian there and
61,11482,abandoned him hastily to {391} his fate--he was shot by the
61,11483,Mexicans--when the victorious Federal Government showed its teeth.
61,11487,In 1870 came a long-pending struggle for predominance in Europe
61,11488,between France and Prussia.  Prussia had long foreseen and
61,11489,"prepared for this struggle, and France was rotten with financial"
61,11490,corruption.  Her defeat was swift and dramatic.  The Germans
61,11491,"invaded France in August, one great French army under the Emperor"
61,11492,"capitulated at Sedan in September, another surrendered in October"
61,11493,"at Metz, and in January 1871, Paris, after a siege and"
61,11494,"bombardment, fell into German hands.  Peace was signed at"
61,11495,Frankfort surrendering the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to the
61,11496,"Germans.  {392} Germany, excluding Austria, was unified as an"
61,11497,"empire, and the King of Prussia was added to the galaxy of"
61,11498,"European Caesars, as the German Emperor."
61,11500,For the next forty-three years Germany was the leading power upon
61,11501,"the European continent.  There was a Russo-Turkish war in 1877-8,"
61,11502,"but thereafter, except for certain readjustments in the Balkans,"
61,11503,European frontiers remained uneasily stable for thirty years.
62,11515,The end of the eighteenth century was a period of disrupting
62,11516,empires and disillusioned expansionists.  The long and tedious
62,11517,journey between Britain and Spain and their colonies in America
62,11518,prevented any really free coming and going between the home land
62,11519,"and the daughter lands, and so the colonies separated into new and"
62,11520,"distinct communities, with distinctive ideas and interests and"
62,11521,even modes of speech.  As they grew they strained more and more at
62,11522,the feeble and uncertain link of shipping that had joined them.
62,11523,"Weak trading-posts in the wilderness, like those of France in"
62,11524,"Canada, or trading establishments in great alien communities, like"
62,11525,"those of Britain in India, might well cling for bare existence to"
62,11526,the nation which gave them support and a reason for their
62,11527,existence.  That much and no more seemed to many thinkers in the
62,11528,early part of the nineteenth century to be the limit set to
62,11529,"overseas rule.  In 1820 the sketchy great European ""empires"""
62,11530,outside of Europe that had figured so bravely in the maps of the
62,11531,"middle eighteenth century, had shrunken to very small dimensions."
62,11532,Only the Russian sprawled as large as ever across Asia.
62,11534,The British Empire in 1815 consisted of the thinly populated
62,11535,"coastal river and lake regions of Canada, and a great hinterland"
62,11536,of wilderness in which the only settlements as yet were the
62,11537,"fur-trading stations of the Hudson Bay Company, about a third of"
62,11538,"the Indian peninsula, under the rule of the East India Company,"
62,11539,the coast districts of the Cape of Good Hope inhabited by blacks
62,11540,and rebellious-spirited Dutch settlers; a few trading stations on
62,11541,"the coast of West Africa, the rock of Gibraltar, the island of"
62,11542,"Malta, Jamaica, a few minor slave-labour possessions in the West"
62,11543,"Indies, British Guiana in South America, and, on the other side of"
62,11544,"the world, two dumps for convicts at Botany Bay in Australia and"
62,11545,in Tasmania.  Spain retained Cuba and a few settlements in the
62,11546,Philippine Islands.  {394} Portugal had in Africa some vestiges of
62,11547,her ancient claims.  Holland had various islands and possessions
62,11548,"in the East Indies and Dutch Guiana, and Denmark an island or so"
62,11549,in the West Indies.  France had one or two West Indian islands and
62,11550,French Guiana.  This seemed to be as much as the European powers
62,11551,"needed, or were likely to acquire of the rest of the world.  Only"
62,11552,the East India Company showed any spirit of expansion.
62,11554,While Europe was busy with the Napoleonic wars the East India
62,11555,"Company, under a succession of Governors-General, was playing much"
62,11556,the same role in India that had been played before by Turkoman and
62,11557,such-like invaders from the north.  And after the peace of Vienna
62,11558,"it went on, levying its revenues, making wars, sending ambassadors"
62,11559,"to Asiatic powers, a quasi-independent state, however, with a"
62,11560,marked disposition to send wealth westward.
62,11562,We cannot tell here in any detail how the British Company made its
62,11563,"way to supremacy sometimes as the ally of this power, sometimes as"
62,11564,"that, and finally as the conqueror of all.  Its power spread to"
62,11565,"Assam, Sind, Oudh.  The map of India began to take on the outlines"
62,11566,"familiar to the English schoolboy of to-day, a patchwork of native"
62,11567,states embraced and held together by the great provinces under
62,11568,direct British rule. . . .
62,11570,"In 1859, following upon a serious mutiny of the native troops in"
62,11571,"India, this empire of the East India Company was annexed to the"
62,11572,British Crown.  By an Act entitled _An Act for the Better
62,11573,"Government of India_, the Governor-General became a Viceroy"
62,11574,"representing the Sovereign, and the place of the Company was taken"
62,11575,by a Secretary of State for India responsible to the British
62,11576,"Parliament.  In 1877, Lord Beaconsfield, to complete the work,"
62,11577,caused Queen Victoria to be proclaimed Empress of India.
62,11579,Upon these extraordinary lines India and Britain are linked at the
62,11580,"present time.  India is still the empire of the Great Mogul, but"
62,11581,"the Great Mogul has been replaced by the ""crowned republic"" of"
62,11582,Great Britain.  India is an autocracy without an autocrat.  Its
62,11583,rule combines the disadvantage of absolute monarchy with the
62,11584,impersonality and irresponsibility of democratic officialdom.  The
62,11585,Indian with a complaint to make has no visible monarch to go to;
62,11586,his Emperor is a golden symbol; he must circulate pamphlets in
62,11587,England {395} or inspire a question in the British House of
62,11588,"Commons.  The more occupied Parliament is with British affairs,"
62,11589,"the less attention India will receive, and the more she will be at"
62,11590,the mercy of her small group of higher officials.
62,11595,"Apart from India, there was no great expansion of any European"
62,11596,Empire until the railways and the steamships were in effective
62,11597,action.  A considerable school of political thinkers in Britain
62,11598,was disposed to regard overseas possessions as a source of
62,11599,weakness to the kingdom.  The Australian settlements developed
62,11600,"slowly until in 1842 the discovery of valuable copper mines, and"
62,11601,"in 1851 of gold, gave them a new importance.  Improvements in"
62,11602,transport were also making Australian wool an increasingly
62,11603,"marketable commodity in Europe.  {396} Canada, too, was not"
62,11604,remarkably progressive until 1849; it was troubled by dissensions
62,11605,"between its French and British inhabitants, there were several"
62,11606,"serious revolts, and it was only in 1867 that a new constitution"
62,11607,creating a Federal Dominion of Canada relieved its internal
62,11608,strains.  It was the railway that altered the Canadian outlook.
62,11609,"It enabled Canada, just as it enabled the United States, to expand"
62,11610,"westward, to market its corn and other produce in Europe, and in"
62,11611,"spite of its swift and extensive growth, to remain in language and"
62,11612,"sympathy and interests one community.  The railway, the steamship"
62,11613,and the telegraph cable were indeed changing all the conditions of
62,11614,colonial development.
62,11616,"Before 1840, English settlements had already begun in New Zealand,"
62,11617,and a New Zealand Land Company had been formed to exploit the
62,11618,possibilities of the island.  In 1840 New Zealand also was added
62,11619,to the colonial possessions of the British Crown.
62,11621,"Canada, as we have noted, was the first of the British possessions"
62,11622,to respond richly to the new economic possibilities that the new
62,11623,methods of transport were opening.  Presently the republics of
62,11624,"South America, and particularly the Argentine Republic, began to"
62,11625,feel in their cattle trade and coffee growing the increased
62,11626,nearness of the European market.  Hitherto the chief commodities
62,11627,that had attracted the European powers into unsettled and barbaric
62,11628,"regions had been gold or other metals, spices, ivory, or slaves."
62,11629,But in the latter quarter of the nineteenth century the increase
62,11630,of the European populations was obliging their governments to look
62,11631,abroad for staple foods; and the growth of scientific
62,11632,"industrialism was creating a demand for new raw materials, fats"
62,11633,"and greases of every kind, rubber, and other hitherto disregarded"
62,11634,substances.  It was plain that Great Britain and Holland and
62,11635,Portugal were reaping a great and growing commercial advantage
62,11636,from their very considerable control of tropical and sub-tropical
62,11637,"products.  After 1871 Germany, and presently France and later"
62,11638,"Italy, began to look for unannexed raw-material areas, or for"
62,11639,Oriental countries capable of profitable modernization.
62,11641,"So began a fresh scramble all over the world, except in the"
62,11642,American region where the Monroe Doctrine now barred such
62,11643,"adventures, for politically unprotected lands."
62,11649,"Close to Europe was the continent of Africa, full of vaguely known"
62,11650,possibilities.  In 1850 it was a continent of black mystery; only
62,11651,Egypt and the coast were known.  Here we have no space to tell the
62,11652,amazing story of the explorers and adventurers who first pierced
62,11653,"the African darkness, and of the political agents, administrators,"
62,11654,"traders, settlers and scientific men who followed in their track."
62,11655,"Wonderful races of men like the pygmies, strange beasts like the"
62,11656,"okapi, marvellous fruits and flowers and insects, terrible"
62,11657,"diseases, astounding scenery of forest and mountain, enormous"
62,11658,inland seas and gigantic rivers and cascades were revealed; a
62,11659,whole new world.  Even remains (at Zimbabwe) of some unrecorded
62,11660,"and vanished civilization, the southward enterprise of an early"
62,11661,"people, were discovered.  Into this new world came the Europeans,"
62,11662,and found the rifle already there in the hands of the Arab
62,11663,"slave-traders, and negro life in disorder."
62,11665,"By 1900, in half a century, all Africa was mapped, explored,"
62,11666,estimated and divided between the European powers.  Little heed
62,11667,was given to the welfare of the natives in this scramble.  The
62,11668,"Arab slaver was indeed curbed rather than expelled, but the greed"
62,11669,"for rubber, which was a wild product collected under compulsion by"
62,11670,"the natives in the Belgian Congo, a greed exacerbated by the clash"
62,11671,of inexperienced European administrators with the native {398}
62,11672,"population, led to horrible atrocities.  No European power has"
62,11673,perfectly clean hands in this matter.
62,11675,We cannot tell here in any detail how Great Britain got possession
62,11676,of Egypt in 1883 and remained there in spite of the fact that
62,11677,"Egypt was technically a part of the Turkish Empire, nor how nearly"
62,11678,"this scramble led to war between France and Great Britain in 1898,"
62,11679,"when a certain Colonel Marchand, crossing Central Africa from the"
62,11680,"west coast, tried at Fashoda to seize the Upper Nile."
62,11682,"Nor can we tell how the British Government first let the Boers, or"
62,11683,"Dutch settlers, of the Orange River district and the Transvaal set"
62,11684,"up independent republics in the inland parts of South Africa, and"
62,11685,then repented and annexed the Transvaal Republic in 1877; nor how
62,11686,the Transvaal Boers fought for freedom and won it after the battle
62,11687,of Majuba Hill (1881).  Majuba Hill was made to rankle in the
62,11688,memory of the English people by a persistent press campaign.  A
62,11689,"war with both republics broke out in 1899, a three years' war"
62,11690,"enormously costly to the British people, which ended at last in"
62,11691,the surrender of the two republics.
62,11693,"Their period of subjugation was a brief one.  In 1907, after the"
62,11694,"downfall of the imperialist government which had conquered them,"
62,11695,"the Liberals took the South African problem in hand, and these"
62,11696,former republics became free and fairly willing associates with
62,11697,Cape Colony and  Natal in a Confederation of all the states of
62,11698,South Africa as one self-governing republic under the British
62,11699,Crown.
62,11701,In a quarter of a century the partition of Africa was completed.
62,11702,There remained unannexed three comparatively small countries:
62,11703,"Liberia, a settlement of liberated negro slaves on the west coast;"
62,11704,"Morocco, under a Moslem Sultan; and Abyssinia, a barbaric country,"
62,11705,"with an ancient and peculiar form of Christianity, which had"
62,11706,successfully maintained its independence against Italy at the
62,11707,battle of Adowa in 1896.
63,11719,It is difficult to believe that any large number of people really
63,11720,accepted this headlong painting of the map of Africa in European
63,11721,"colours as a permanent new settlement of the worlds affairs, but"
63,11722,it is the duty of the historian to record that it was so accepted.
63,11723,There was but a shallow historical background to the European mind
63,11724,"in the nineteenth century, and no habit of penetrating criticism."
63,11725,The quite temporary advantages that the mechanical revolution in
63,11726,the west had given the Europeans over the rest of the old world
63,11727,"were regarded by people, blankly ignorant of such events as the"
63,11728,"great Mongol conquests, as evidences of a permanent and assured"
63,11729,European leadership of mankind.  They had no sense of the
63,11730,transferability of science and its fruits.  They did not realize
63,11731,that Chinamen and Indians could carry on the work of research as
63,11732,ably as Frenchmen or Englishmen.  They believed that there was
63,11733,"some innate intellectual drive in the west, and some innate"
63,11734,"indolence and conservatism in the east, that assured the Europeans"
63,11735,a world predominance for ever.
63,11737,The consequence of this infatuation was that the various European
63,11738,foreign offices set themselves not merely to scramble with the
63,11739,British for the savage and undeveloped regions of the world's
63,11740,"surface, but also to carve up the populous and civilized countries"
63,11741,of Asia as though these people also were no more than raw material
63,11742,for exploitation.  The inwardly precarious but outwardly splendid
63,11743,"imperialism of the British ruling class in India, and the"
63,11744,extensive and profitable possessions of the Dutch in the East
63,11745,"Indies, filled the rival Great Powers with dreams of similar"
63,11746,"glories in Persia, in the disintegrating Ottoman Empire, and in"
63,11747,"Further India, China and Japan."
63,11751,In 1898 Germany seized Kiau Chau in China.  Britain responded by
63,11752,"seizing Wei-hai-wei, and the next year the Russians took"
63,11753,possession of Port Arthur.  A flame of hatred for the Europeans
63,11754,swept through China.  There were massacres of Europeans and
63,11755,"Christian converts, and in 1900 an attack upon and siege of the"
63,11756,European legations in Pekin.  A combined force of Europeans made a
63,11757,"punitive expedition to Pekin, rescued the legations, and stole an"
63,11758,enormous amount of valuable property.  The Russians then seized
63,11759,"Manchuria, and in 1904, the British invaded Tibet...."
63,11761,"But now a new Power appeared in the struggle of the Great Powers,"
63,11762,Japan.  Hitherto Japan has played but a small part in this
63,11763,history; her secluded civilization has not contributed very
63,11764,largely to the general shaping of human destinies; she has
63,11765,"received much, but she has given little.  The Japanese proper are"
63,11766,"of the Mongolian race.  Their civilization, their writing and"
63,11767,their literary and artistic traditions are derived from the
63,11768,Chinese.  Their history is an interesting and romantic one; they
63,11769,developed a feudal system and a system of chivalry in the earlier
63,11770,centuries of the Christian era; their attacks upon Korea and China
63,11771,are an Eastern equivalent of the English wars in France.  Japan
63,11772,was first brought into contact with Europe in the sixteenth
63,11773,"century; in 1542 some Portuguese reached it in a Chinese junk, and"
63,11774,"in 1549 a Jesuit missionary, Francis Xavier, began his teaching"
63,11775,"there.  For a time Japan welcomed European intercourse, and the"
63,11776,Christian missionaries made a great number of converts.  A certain
63,11777,William Adams became the most trusted European adviser of the
63,11778,"Japanese, and showed them how to build big ships.  There were"
63,11779,voyages in Japanese-built ships to India and Peru.  Then arose
63,11780,"complicated quarrels between the Spanish Dominicans, the"
63,11781,"Portuguese Jesuits, and the English and Dutch Protestants, each"
63,11782,warning the Japanese against the political designs of the others.
63,11783,"The Jesuits, in a phase of ascendancy, persecuted and insulted the"
63,11784,Buddhists with great acrimony.  In the end the Japanese came to
63,11785,"the conclusion that the Europeans were an intolerable nuisance,"
63,11786,and that Catholic Christianity in particular was a mere cloak for
63,11787,the political dreams of the Pope and the Spanish monarchy--already
63,11788,in possession of the Philippine Islands; there was a great
63,11789,"persecution of the Christians, and in 1638 Japan was absolutely"
63,11790,"{401} closed to Europeans, and remained closed for over 200 years."
63,11791,During those two centuries the Japanese were as completely cut off
63,11792,from the rest of the world as though they lived upon another
63,11793,planet.  It was forbidden to build any ship larger than a mere
63,11794,"coasting boat.  No Japanese could go abroad, and no European enter"
63,11795,the country.
63,11799,For two centuries Japan remained outside the main current of
63,11800,history.  She lived on in a state of picturesque feudalism in
63,11801,"which about five per cent of the population, the _samurai_, or"
63,11802,"fighting men, and the nobles and their families, tyrannized"
63,11803,without restraint over the rest of the population.  Meanwhile the
63,11804,great world outside went on to wider visions and new powers.
63,11805,"Strange shipping became more frequent, passing the Japanese"
63,11806,headlands; sometimes ships were wrecked and sailors brought
63,11807,"ashore.  Through the Dutch settlement in the island of Deshima,"
63,11808,"their one link with the outer universe, came warnings that Japan"
63,11809,was not keeping pace with the power of the Western world.  In 1837
63,11810,a ship sailed into Yedo Bay flying a strange flag of stripes and
63,11811,"stars, and carrying some Japanese sailors she had picked up far"
63,11812,adrift in the Pacific.  She was driven off by cannon shot.  This
63,11813,flag presently reappeared on other ships.  One in 1849 came to
63,11814,demand the liberation {402} of eighteen shipwrecked American
63,11815,sailors.  Then in 1853 came four American warships under Commodore
63,11816,"Perry, and refused to be driven away.  He lay at anchor in"
63,11817,"forbidden waters, and sent messages to the two rulers who at that"
63,11818,time shared the control of Japan.  In 1854 he returned with ten
63,11819,"ships, amazing ships propelled by steam, and equipped with big"
63,11820,"guns, and he made proposals for trade and intercourse that the"
63,11821,Japanese had no power to resist.  He landed with a guard of 500
63,11822,men to sign the treaty.  Incredulous crowds watched this
63,11823,"visitation from the outer world, marching through the streets."
63,11825,"Russia, Holland and Britain followed in the wake of America.  A"
63,11826,great nobleman whose estates commanded the Straits of Shimonoseki
63,11827,"saw fit to fire on foreign vessels, and a bombardment by a fleet"
63,11828,"of British, French, Dutch and American warships destroyed his"
63,11829,batteries and scattered his swordsmen.  Finally an allied squadron
63,11830,"(1865), at anchor off Kioto, imposed a ratification of the"
63,11831,treaties which opened Japan to the world.
63,11833,The humiliation of the Japanese by these events was intense.  With
63,11834,astonishing energy and intelligence they set themselves to bring
63,11835,their culture and organization to the level of the European
63,11836,Powers.  Never in all the history of mankind did a nation make
63,11837,such a stride as Japan then did.  In 1866 she was a medieval
63,11838,"people, a fantastic caricature of the extremest romantic"
63,11839,"feudalism; in 1899 hers was a completely Westernized people, on a"
63,11840,level with the most advanced European Powers.  She completely
63,11841,dispelled the persuasion that Asia was in some irrevocable way
63,11842,hopelessly behind Europe.  She made all European progress seem
63,11843,sluggish by comparison.
63,11845,We cannot tell here in any detail of Japan's war with China in
63,11846,1894-95.  It demonstrated the extent of her Westernization.  She
63,11847,had an efficient Westernized army and a small but sound fleet.
63,11848,"But the significance of her renascence, though it was appreciated"
63,11849,"by Britain and the United States, who were already treating her as"
63,11850,"if she were a European state, was not understood by the other"
63,11851,Great Powers engaged in the pursuit of new Indias in Asia.  Russia
63,11852,was pushing down through Manchuria to Korea.  France was already
63,11853,"established far to the south in Tonkin and Annam, Germany was"
63,11854,{403} prowling hungrily on the look-out for some settlement.  The
63,11855,three Powers combined to prevent Japan reaping any fruits from the
63,11856,"Chinese war.  She was exhausted by the struggle, and they"
63,11857,threatened her with war.
63,11861,Japan submitted for a time and gathered her forces.  Within ten
63,11862,"years she was ready for a struggle with Russia, which marks an"
63,11863,"epoch in the history of Asia, the close of the period of European"
63,11864,"arrogance.  The Russian people were, of course, innocent and"
63,11865,ignorant of this trouble that was being made for them halfway
63,11866,"round the world, and the wiser Russian statesmen were against"
63,11867,"these foolish thrusts; but a gang of financial adventurers,"
63,11868,"including the Grand Dukes, his cousins, surrounded the Tsar.  They"
63,11869,had gambled deeply in the prospective looting of Manchuria and
63,11870,"China, and they would suffer no withdrawal.  So there began a"
63,11871,transportation of great armies of Japanese soldiers across the sea
63,11872,"to Port Arthur and Korea, and the sending of endless trainloads of"
63,11873,Russian peasants along the Siberian railway to die in those
63,11874,distant battlefields.
63,11878,"The Russians, badly led and dishonestly provided, were beaten on"
63,11879,sea and land alike.  The Russian Baltic Fleet sailed round Africa
63,11880,to be utterly destroyed in the Straits of Tshushima.  A
63,11881,"revolutionary movement among the common people of Russia,"
63,11882,"infuriated by this remote and reasonless slaughter, obliged the"
63,11883,Tsar to end the war (1905); he returned the southern half of
63,11884,"Saghalien, which had been seized by Russia in 1875, evacuated"
63,11885,"Manchuria, resigned Korea to Japan.  The European invasion of Asia"
63,11886,was coming to an end and the retraction of Europe's tentacles was
63,11887,beginning.
64,11899,We may note here briefly the varied nature of the constituents of
64,11900,the British Empire in 1914 which the steamship and railway had
64,11901,brought together.  It was and is a quite unique political
64,11902,combination; nothing of the sort has ever existed before.
64,11904,"First and central to the whole system was the ""crowned republic"""
64,11905,"of the United British Kingdom, including (against the will of a"
64,11906,considerable part of the Irish people) Ireland.  The majority of
64,11907,"the British Parliament, made up of the three united parliaments of"
64,11908,"England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, determines the headship,"
64,11909,"the quality and policy of the ministry, and determines it largely"
64,11910,on considerations arising out of British domestic politics.  It is
64,11911,"this ministry which is the effective supreme government, with"
64,11912,"powers of peace and war, over all the rest of the empire."
64,11914,Next in order of political importance to the British States were
64,11915,"the ""crowned republics"" of Australia, Canada, Newfoundland (the"
64,11916,"oldest British possession, 1583), New Zealand and South Africa,"
64,11917,all practically independent and self-governing states in alliance
64,11918,"with Great Britain, but each with a representative of the Crown"
64,11919,appointed by the Government in office;
64,11921,"Next the Indian Empire, an extension of the Empire of the Great"
64,11922,"Mogul with its dependent and ""protected"" states reaching now from"
64,11923,"Beluchistan to Burma, and including Aden, in all of which empire"
64,11924,the British Crown and the India Office (under Parliamentary
64,11925,control) played the role of the original Turkoman dynasty;
64,11927,"Then the ambiguous possession of Egypt, still nominally a part of"
64,11928,"the Turkish Empire and still retaining its own monarch, the"
64,11929,"Khedive, but under almost despotic British official rule;"
64,11931,"Then the still more ambiguous ""Anglo-Egyptian"" Sudan province,"
64,11932,{407} occupied and administered jointly by the British and by the
64,11933,(British controlled) Egyptian Government;
64,11935,"Then a number of partially self-governing communities, some"
64,11936,"British in origin and some not, with elected legislatures and an"
64,11937,"appointed executive, such as Malta, Jamaica, the Bahamas and"
64,11938,Bermuda;
64,11940,"Then the Crown colonies, in which the rule of the British Home"
64,11941,"Government (through the Colonial Office) verged on autocracy, as"
64,11942,"in Ceylon, Trinidad and Fiji (where there was an appointed"
64,11943,"council), and Gibraltar and St. Helena (where there was a"
64,11944,governor);
64,11946,"Then great areas of (chiefly) tropical lands, raw-product areas,"
64,11947,with politically weak and under-civilized native communities which
64,11948,"were nominally protectorates, and administered either by a High"
64,11949,Commissioner set over native chiefs (as in Basutoland) or over a
64,11950,chartered company (as in Rhodesia).  In some cases the Foreign
64,11951,"Office, in some cases the Colonial Office, and in some cases the"
64,11952,"India Office, has been concerned in acquiring the possessions that"
64,11953,"fell into this last and least definite class of all, but for the"
64,11954,most part the Colonial Office was now responsible for them.
64,11966,"It will be manifest, therefore, that no single office and no"
64,11967,single brain had ever comprehended the British Empire as a whole.
64,11968,It was a mixture of growths and accumulations entirely different
64,11969,from anything that has ever been called an empire before.  It
64,11970,guaranteed a wide peace and security; that is why it was endured
64,11971,"and sustained by many men of the ""subject"" races--in spite of"
64,11972,"official tyrannies {408} and insufficiencies, and of much"
64,11973,"negligence on the part of the ""home"" public.  Like the Athenian"
64,11974,"Empire, it was an overseas empire; its ways were sea ways, and its"
64,11975,"common link was the British Navy.  Like all empires, its cohesion"
64,11976,was dependent physically upon a method of communication; the
64,11977,"development of seamanship, ship-building and steamships between"
64,11978,the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries had made it a possible and
64,11979,"convenient Pax--the ""Pax Britannica,"" and fresh developments of"
64,11980,air or swift land transport might at any time make it
64,11981,inconvenient.
65,11995,The progress in material science that created this vast
65,11996,steamboat-and-railway republic of America and spread this
65,11997,"precarious British steamship empire over the world, produced"
65,11998,quite other effects upon the congested nations upon the continent
65,11999,of Europe.  They found themselves confined within boundaries fixed
65,12000,"during the horse-and-high-road period of human life, and their"
65,12001,expansion overseas had been very largely anticipated by Great
65,12002,Britain.  Only Russia had any freedom to expand eastward; and she
65,12003,drove a great railway across Siberia until she entangled herself
65,12004,"in a conflict with Japan, and pushed south-eastwardly towards the"
65,12005,borders of Persia and India to the annoyance of Britain.  The rest
65,12006,of the European Powers were in a state of intensifying congestion.
65,12007,In order to realize the full possibilities of the new apparatus of
65,12008,human life they had to rearrange their affairs upon a broader
65,12009,"basis, either by some sort of voluntary union or by a union"
65,12010,imposed upon them by some predominant power.  The tendency
65,12011,"of modern thought was in the direction of the former alternative,"
65,12012,but all the force of political tradition drove Europe towards the
65,12013,latter.
65,12015,"The downfall of the ""empire"" of Napoleon III, the establishment of"
65,12016,"the new German Empire, pointed men's hopes and fears towards the"
65,12017,idea of a Europe consolidated under German auspices.  For
65,12018,thirty-six years of uneasy peace the polities of Europe centred
65,12019,"upon that possibility.  France, the steadfast rival of Germany for"
65,12020,European ascendancy since the division of the empire of
65,12021,"Charlemagne, sought to correct her own weakness by a close"
65,12022,"alliance with Russia, and Germany linked herself closely with the"
65,12023,Austrian Empire (it had ceased to be the Holy Roman Empire in the
65,12024,days of Napoleon I) and less successfully with the new kingdom of
65,12025,Italy.  {410} At first Great Britain stood as usual half in and
65,12026,half out of continental affairs.  But she was gradually forced
65,12027,into a close association with the Franco-Russian group by the
65,12028,aggressive development of a great German navy.  The grandiose
65,12029,imagination of the Emperor William II (1888-1918) thrust Germany
65,12030,into premature overseas enterprise that ultimately brought not
65,12031,only Great Britain but Japan and the United States into the
65,12032,circle of her enemies.
65,12036,All these nations armed.  Year after year the proportion of
65,12037,"national production devoted to the making of guns, equipment,"
65,12038,"battleships and the like, increased. Year after year the balance"
65,12039,"{411} of things seemed trembling towards war, and then war would"
65,12040,be averted.  At last it came.  Germany and Austria struck at
65,12041,France and Russia and Serbia; the German armies marching through
65,12042,"Belgium, Britain immediately came into the war on the side of"
65,12043,"Belgium, bringing in Japan as her ally, and very soon Turkey"
65,12044,followed on the German side.  Italy entered the war against
65,12045,"Austria in 1915, and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in the"
65,12046,"October of that year.  In 1916 Rumania, and in 1917 the United"
65,12047,States and China were forced into war against Germany.  It is not
65,12048,within the scope of this history to define the exact share of
65,12049,blame for this vast catastrophe.  The more interesting question is
65,12050,not why the Great War was begun but why the Great War was not
65,12051,anticipated and prevented.  It is a far graver thing for mankind
65,12052,"that scores of millions of people were too ""patriotic,"" stupid, or"
65,12053,apathetic to prevent this disaster by a movement towards European
65,12054,"unity upon frank and generous lines, than that a small number of"
65,12055,people may have been active in bringing it about.
65,12060,It is impossible within the space at our command here to trace the
65,12061,intricate details of the war.  Within a few months it became
65,12062,apparent that the progress of modern technical science had changed
65,12063,{412} the nature of warfare very profoundly.  Physical science
65,12064,"gives power, power over steel, over distance, over disease;"
65,12065,whether that power is used well or ill depends upon the moral and
65,12066,"political intelligence of the world.  The governments of Europe,"
65,12067,"inspired by antiquated policies of hate and suspicion, found"
65,12068,themselves with unexampled powers both of destruction and
65,12069,resistance in their hands.  The war became a consuming fire round
65,12070,"and about the world, causing losses both to victors and vanquished"
65,12071,out of all proportion to the issues involved.  The first phase of
65,12072,the war was a tremendous rush of the Germans upon Paris and an
65,12073,invasion of East Prussia by the Russians.  Both attacks were held
65,12074,and turned.  Then the power of the defensive developed; there was
65,12075,a rapid elaboration of trench warfare until for a time the
65,12076,"opposing armies lay entrenched in long lines right across Europe,"
65,12077,unable to make any advance without enormous losses.  The armies
65,12078,"were millions strong, and behind them entire populations were"
65,12079,organized for the supply of food and munitions to the front.  Then
65,12080,was a cessation of nearly every sort of productive activity except
65,12081,such as contributed to military operations.  All the able-bodied
65,12082,manhood of Europe was drawn into the armies or navies or into the
65,12083,improvised factories that served {413} them.  There was an
65,12084,enormous replacement of men by women in industry.  Probably more
65,12085,than half the people in the belligerent countries of Europe
65,12086,changed their employment altogether during this stupendous
65,12087,struggle.  They were socially uprooted and transplanted.
65,12088,Education and normal scientific work were restricted or diverted
65,12089,"to immediate military ends, and the distribution of news was"
65,12090,"crippled and corrupted by military control and ""propaganda"""
65,12091,activities.
65,12095,The phase of military deadlock passed slowly into one of
65,12096,aggression upon the combatant populations behind the fronts by the
65,12097,destruction of food supplies and by attacks through the air.  And
65,12098,also there was a steady improvement in the size and range of the
65,12099,guns employed and of such ingenious devices as poison-gas shells
65,12100,"and the small mobile forts known as tanks, to break down the"
65,12101,resistance of troops in the trenches.  The air offensive was the
65,12102,most revolutionary of all the new methods.  It carried warfare
65,12103,from two dimensions into three.  Hitherto in the history of
65,12104,mankind war had gone on only where the armies marched and met.
65,12105,Now it went on everywhere.  First the Zeppelin and then the
65,12106,bombing aeroplane carried war over and past the front to an
65,12107,ever-increasing area of civilian activities beyond.  The old
65,12108,distinction maintained in civilized warfare between the civilian
65,12109,"and combatant population disappeared.  Everyone who grew food, or"
65,12110,"who sewed a garment, everyone who felled a tree or repaired a"
65,12111,"house, every railway station and every warehouse was held to be"
65,12112,fair game for destruction.  The air offensive increased in range
65,12113,and terror with every month in the war.  At last great areas of
65,12114,Europe were in a state of siege and subject to nightly raids.
65,12115,Such exposed cities as London and Paris passed sleepless night
65,12116,"after sleepless night while the bombs burst, the anti-aircraft"
65,12117,"guns maintained an intolerable racket, and the fire engines and"
65,12118,ambulances rattled headlong through the darkened and deserted
65,12119,streets.  The effects upon the minds and health of old people and
65,12120,of young children were particularly distressing and destructive.
65,12122,"Pestilence, that old follower of warfare, did not arrive until the"
65,12123,very end of the fighting in 1918.  For four years medical science
65,12124,staved off any general epidemic; then came a great outbreak of
65,12125,{414} influenza about the world which destroyed many millions of
65,12126,people.  Famine also was staved off for some time.  By the
65,12127,beginning of 1918 however most of Europe was in a state of
65,12128,mitigated and regulated famine.  The production of food throughout
65,12129,the world had fallen very greatly through the calling off of
65,12130,"peasant mankind to the fronts, and the distribution of such food"
65,12131,"as was produced was impeded by the havoc wrought by the submarine,"
65,12132,by the rupture of customary routes through the closing of
65,12133,"frontiers, and by the disorganization of the transport system of"
65,12134,the world.  The various governments took possession of the
65,12135,"dwindling food supplies, and, with more or less success, rationed"
65,12136,their populations.  By the fourth year the whole world was
65,12137,suffering from shortages of clothing and housing and of most of
65,12138,the normal gear of life as well as of food.  Business and economic
65,12139,"life were profoundly disorganized.  Every-one was worried, and"
65,12140,most people were leading lives of unwonted discomfort.
65,12142,"The actual warfare ceased in November, 1918.  After a supreme"
65,12143,effort in the spring of 1918 that almost carried the Germans to
65,12144,"Paris, the Central Powers collapsed.  They had come to an end of"
65,12145,their spirit and resources.
66,12157,But a good year and more before the collapse of the Central Powers
66,12158,"the half oriental monarchy of Russia, which had professed to be"
66,12159,"the continuation of the Byzantine Empire, had collapsed.  The"
66,12160,Tsardom had been showing signs of profound rottenness for some
66,12161,years before the war; the court was under the sway of a fantastic
66,12162,"religious impostor, Rasputin, and the public administration, civil"
66,12163,"and military, was in a state of extreme inefficiency and"
66,12164,corruption.  At the outset of the war there was a great flare of
66,12165,patriotic enthusiasm in Russia.  A vast conscript army was called
66,12166,"up, for which there was neither adequate military equipment nor a"
66,12167,"proper supply of competent officers, and this great host, ill"
66,12168,"supplied and badly handled, was hurled against the German and"
66,12169,Austrian frontiers.
66,12171,There can be no doubt that the early appearance of Russian armies
66,12172,"in East Prussia in September, 1914, diverted the energies and"
66,12173,attention of the Germans from their first victorious drive upon
66,12174,Paris.  The sufferings and deaths of scores of thousands of
66,12175,ill-led Russian peasants saved France from complete overthrow in
66,12176,"that momentous opening campaign, and made all western Europe the"
66,12177,debtors of that great and tragic people.  But the strain of the
66,12178,"war upon this sprawling, ill-organized empire was too heavy for"
66,12179,its strength.  The Russian common soldiers were sent into battle
66,12180,"without guns to support them, without even rifle ammunition; they"
66,12181,were wasted by their officers and generals in a delirium of
66,12182,militarist enthusiasm.  For a time they seemed to be suffering
66,12183,mutely as the beasts suffer; but there is a limit to the endurance
66,12184,even of the most ignorant.  A profound disgust for Tsardom was
66,12185,creeping through these armies of betrayed and wasted men.  From
66,12186,the close of 1915 onward Russia was a source of deepening anxiety
66,12187,to her Western Allies.  Throughout 1916 she remained largely on
66,12188,"{416} the defensive, and there were rumours of a separate peace"
66,12189,with Germany.
66,12191,"On December 29th, 1916, the monk Rasputin was murdered at a dinner"
66,12192,"party in Petrograd, and a belated attempt was made to put the"
66,12193,Tsardom in order.  By March things were moving rapidly; food riots
66,12194,in Petrograd developed into a revolutionary insurrection; there
66,12195,"was an attempted suppression of the Duma, the representative body,"
66,12196,"there were attempted arrests of liberal leaders, the formation of"
66,12197,"a provisional government under Prince Lvoff, and an abdication"
66,12198,(March 15th) by the Tsar.  For a time it seemed that a moderate
66,12199,and controlled revolution might be possible--perhaps under a new
66,12200,Tsar.  Then it became evident that the destruction of popular
66,12201,confidence in Russia had gone too far for any such adjustments.
66,12202,The Russian people were sick to death of the old order of things
66,12203,"in Europe, of Tsars and wars and of Great Powers; it wanted"
66,12204,"relief, and that speedily, from unendurable miseries.  The Allies"
66,12205,had no understanding of Russian realities; their diplomatists were
66,12206,"ignorant of Russian, genteel persons with their attention directed"
66,12207,"to the Russian Court rather than to Russia, they blundered"
66,12208,steadily with the new situation.  There was little goodwill among
66,12209,"these diplomatists for republicanism, and a manifest disposition"
66,12210,to embarrass the new government as much as possible.  At the head
66,12211,of the Russian republican government was an eloquent and
66,12212,"picturesque leader, Kerensky, who found himself assailed by the"
66,12213,"forces of a profounder revolutionary movement, the ""social"
66,12214,"revolution,"" at home and cold-shouldered by the Allied governments"
66,12215,abroad.  His Allies would neither let him give the Russian
66,12216,peasants the land for which they craved nor peace beyond their
66,12217,frontiers.  The French and the British press pestered their
66,12218,"exhausted ally for a fresh offensive, but when presently the"
66,12219,"Germans made a strong attack by sea and land upon Riga, the"
66,12220,British Admiralty quailed before the prospect of a Baltic
66,12221,expedition in relief.  The new Russian Republic had to fight
66,12222,unsupported.  In spite of their naval predominance and the bitter
66,12223,"protests of the great English admiral, Lord Fisher (1841-1920), it"
66,12224,"is to be noted that the British and their Allies, except for some"
66,12225,"submarine attacks, left the Germans the complete mastery of the"
66,12226,Baltic throughout the war.
66,12230,"The Russian masses, however, were resolute to end the war.  At any"
66,12231,cost.  There had come into existence in Petrograd a body
66,12232,"representing the workers and common soldiers, the Soviet, and this"
66,12233,body clamoured for an international conference of socialists at
66,12234,"Stockholm.  Food riots were occurring in Berlin at this time, war"
66,12235,"weariness in Austria and Germany was profound, and there can be"
66,12236,"little doubt, in the light of subsequent events, that such a"
66,12237,conference would have precipitated a reasonable peace on
66,12238,democratic lines in 1917 and a German revolution.  Kerensky
66,12239,implored his Western allies to allow this conference to take
66,12240,"place, but, fearful of a worldwide outbreak of socialism and"
66,12241,"republicanism, they refused, in spite of the favourable response"
66,12242,of a small majority of the British Labour Party.  Without either
66,12243,"moral or physical help from the Allies, the unhappy ""moderate"""
66,12244,Russian Republic still fought on and made a last desperate
66,12245,offensive effort in July.  It failed after some preliminary
66,12246,"successes, and there came another great slaughtering of Russians."
66,12248,The limit of Russian endurance was reached.  Mutinies broke out in
66,12249,"the Russian armies, and particularly upon the northern front, and"
66,12250,"on November 7th, 1917, Kerensky's government was overthrown and"
66,12251,"power was seized by the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik"
66,12252,"socialists under Lenin, and pledged to make peace regardless of"
66,12253,"the Western powers.  On March 2nd, 1918, a separate peace between"
66,12254,Russia and Germany was signed at Brest-Litovsk.
66,12264,It speedily became evident that these Bolshevik socialists were
66,12265,men of a very different quality from the rhetorical
66,12266,constitutionalists and revolutionaries of the Kerensky phase.
66,12267,They were fanatical Marxist communists.  They believed that their
66,12268,accession to power in Russia was only the opening of a world-wide
66,12269,"social revolution, and they set about changing the social and"
66,12270,economic order with the thoroughness of perfect faith and absolute
66,12271,inexperience.  The western European and the American governments
66,12272,were themselves much too ill-informed and incapable to guide or
66,12273,"help this extraordinary experiment, and the press set itself to"
66,12274,discredit and the ruling classes to wreck these usurpers upon any
66,12275,terms and at any cost to themselves or to Russia.  A propaganda of
66,12276,abominable and disgusting inventions went on unchecked in the
66,12277,press of the {419} world; the Bolshevik leaders were represented
66,12278,as incredible monsters glutted with blood and plunder and living
66,12279,lives of sensuality before which the realities of the Tsarist
66,12280,court during the Rasputin regime paled to a white purity.
66,12281,"Expeditions were launched at the exhausted country, insurgents and"
66,12282,"raiders were encouraged, armed and subsidized, and no method of"
66,12283,attack was too mean or too monstrous for the frightened enemies of
66,12284,"the Bolshevik regime.  In 1919, the Russian Bolsheviks, ruling a"
66,12285,country already exhausted and disorganized by five years of
66,12286,"intensive warfare, were fighting a British Expedition at"
66,12287,"Archangel, Japanese invaders in Eastern Siberia, Roumanians with"
66,12288,"French and Greek contingents in the south, the Russian Admiral"
66,12289,"Koltchak in Siberia and General Deniken, supported by the French"
66,12290,"fleet, in the Crimea.  In July of that year an Esthonian army,"
66,12291,"under General Yudenitch, almost got to Petersburg.  In 1920 the"
66,12292,"Poles, incited by the French, made a new attack on Russia; and a"
66,12293,"new reactionary raider, General Wrangel, took over the task of"
66,12294,General Deniken in invading and devastating his own country.  In
66,12295,"March, 1921, the sailors at Cronstadt revolted.  The Russian"
66,12296,"Government under its president, Lenin, survived all these various"
66,12297,"attacks.  It showed an amazing tenacity, and the common people of"
66,12298,Russia sustained it unswervingly under conditions of extreme
66,12299,hardship.  By the end of 1921 both Britain and Italy had made a
66,12300,sort of recognition of the communist rule.
66,12302,But if the Bolshevik Government was successful in its struggle
66,12303,"against foreign intervention and internal revolt, it was far less"
66,12304,happy in its attempts to set up a new social order based upon
66,12305,communist ideas in Russia.  The Russian peasant is a small
66,12306,"land-hungry proprietor, as far from communism in his thoughts and"
66,12307,methods as a whale is from flying; the revolution gave him the
66,12308,land of the great landowners but could not make him grow food for
66,12309,"anything but negotiable money, and the revolution, among other"
66,12310,"things, had practically destroyed the value of money."
66,12311,"Agricultural production, already greatly disordered by the"
66,12312,"collapse of the railways through war-strain, shrank to a mere"
66,12313,cultivation of food by the peasants for their own consumption.
66,12314,The towns starved.  Hasty and ill-planned attempts to make over
66,12315,industrial production {420} in accordance with communist ideas
66,12316,were equally unsuccessful.  By 1920 Russia presented the
66,12317,unprecedented spectacle of a modern civilization in complete
66,12318,"collapse.  Railways were rusting and passing out of use, towns"
66,12319,"were falling into ruin, everywhere there was an immense mortality."
66,12320,Yet the country still fought with its enemies at its gates.  In
66,12321,1921 came a drought and a great famine among the peasant
66,12322,cultivators in the war-devastated south-east provinces.  Millions
66,12323,of people starved.
66,12325,But the question of the distresses and the possible recuperation
66,12326,of Russia brings us too close to current controversies to be
66,12327,discussed here.

67,12336,THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION OF THE WORLD
67,12337,
67,12338,
67,12339,The scheme and scale upon which this History is planned do not
67,12340,permit us to enter into the complicated and acrimonious disputes
67,12341,"that centre about the treaties, and particularly of the treaty of"
67,12342,"Versailles, which concluded the Great War.  We are beginning to"
67,12343,"realize that that conflict, terrible and enormous as it was, ended"
67,12344,"nothing, began nothing and settled nothing.  It killed millions of"
67,12345,people; it wasted and impoverished the world.  It smashed Russia
67,12346,altogether.  It was at best an acute and frightful reminder that
67,12347,we were living foolishly and confusedly without much plan or
67,12348,foresight in a dangerous and unsympathetic universe.  The crudely
67,12349,organized egotisms and passions of national and imperial greed
67,12350,"that carried mankind into that tragedy, emerged from it"
67,12351,sufficiently unimpaired to make some other similar disaster highly
67,12352,probable so soon as the world has a little recovered from its war
67,12353,exhaustion and fatigue.  Wars and revolutions make nothing; their
67,12354,"utmost service to mankind is that, in a very rough and painful"
67,12355,"way, they destroy superannuated and obstructive things.  The great"
67,12356,"war lifted the threat of German imperialism from Europe, and"
67,12357,shattered the imperialism of Russia.  It cleared away a number of
67,12358,"monarchies.  But a multitude of flags still waves in Europe, the"
67,12359,"frontiers still exasperate, great armies accumulate fresh stores"
67,12360,of equipment.
67,12361,
67,12362,The Peace Conference at Versailles was a gathering very ill
67,12363,adapted to do more than carry out the conflicts and defeats of the
67,12364,"war to their logical conclusions.  The Germans, Austrians, Turks"
67,12365,and Bulgarians were permitted no share in its deliberations; they
67,12366,were only to accept the decisions it dictated to them.  From the
67,12367,point of view of human welfare the choice of the place of meeting
67,12368,"was particularly unfortunate.  It was at Versailles in 1871 that,"
67,12369,"with every circumstance of triumphant vulgarity, the new German"
67,12370,{422} Empire had been proclaimed.  The suggestion of a
67,12371,"melodramatic reversal of that scene, in the same Hall of Mirrors,"
67,12372,was overpowering.
67,12373,
67,12374,Whatever generosities had appeared in the opening phases of the
67,12375,Great War had long been exhausted.  The populations of the
67,12376,victorious countries were acutely aware of their own losses and
67,12377,"sufferings, and entirely regardless of the fact that the defeated"
67,12378,had paid in the like manner.  The war had arisen as a natural and
67,12379,inevitable consequence of the competitive nationalisms of Europe
67,12380,and the absence of any Federal adjustment of these competitive
67,12381,forces; war is the necessary logical consummation of independent
67,12382,sovereign nationalities living in too small an area with too
67,12383,powerful an armament; and if the great war had not come in the
67,12384,form it did it would have come in some similar form--just as it
67,12385,will certainly return upon a still more disastrous scale in twenty
67,12386,or thirty years' time if no political unification anticipates and
67,12387,prevents it.  States organized for war will make wars as surely as
67,12388,"hens will lay eggs, but the feeling of these distressed and"
67,12389,"war-worn countries disregarded this fact, and the whole of the"
67,12390,defeated peoples were treated as morally and materially
67,12391,"responsible for all the damage, as they would no doubt have"
67,12392,treated the victor peoples had the issue of war been different.
67,12393,"The French and English thought the Germans were to blame, the"
67,12394,"Germans thought the Russians, French and English were to blame,"
67,12395,and only an intelligent minority thought that there was anything
67,12396,to blame in the fragmentary political constitution of Europe.  The
67,12397,treaty of Versailles was intended to be exemplary and vindictive;
67,12398,it provided tremendous penalties for the vanquished; it sought to
67,12399,provide compensations for the wounded and suffering victors by
67,12400,"imposing enormous debts upon nations already bankrupt, and its"
67,12401,attempts to reconstitute international relations by the
67,12402,establishment of a League of Nations against war were manifestly
67,12403,insincere and inadequate.
67,12404,
67,12405,[Illustration: PASSENGER AEROPLANE FLYING OVER NORTHOLT]
67,12406,
67,12407,So far as Europe was concerned it is doubtful if there would have
67,12408,been any attempt whatever to organize international relations for
67,12409,a permanent peace.  The proposal of the League of Nations was
67,12410,brought into practical politics by the President of the United
67,12411,"States of America, President Wilson.  Its chief support was in"
67,12412,"America.  So far the United States, this new modern state, had"
67,12413,{423} developed no distinctive ideas of international relationship
67,12414,"beyond the Monroe Doctrine, which protected the new world from"
67,12415,European interference.  Now suddenly it was called upon for its
67,12416,mental contribution to the vast problem of the time.  It had none.
67,12417,The natural disposition of the American people was towards a
67,12418,permanent world peace.  With this however was linked a strong
67,12419,traditional distrust of old-world polities and a habit of
67,12420,isolation from old-world entanglements.  The Americans had hardly
67,12421,begun to think out an American solution of world problems when the
67,12422,submarine campaign of the Germans dragged them into the war on the
67,12423,side of the anti-German allies.  President Wilson's scheme of a
67,12424,League of Nations was an attempt at short notice to create a
67,12425,"distinctively American world project.  It was a sketchy,"
67,12426,inadequate and dangerous scheme.  In Europe however it was taken
67,12427,as a matured American point of view.  The generality of mankind in
67,12428,1918-19 was intensely weary of war and anxious at almost any
67,12429,"sacrifice to erect {424} barriers against its recurrence, but"
67,12430,there was not a single government in the old world willing to
67,12431,waive one iota of its sovereign independence to attain any such
67,12432,end.  The public utterances of President Wilson leading up to the
67,12433,project of a World League of Nations seemed for a time to appeal
67,12434,right over the heads of the governments to the peoples of the
67,12435,world; they were taken as expressing the ripe intentions of
67,12436,"America, and the response was enormous.  Unhappily President"
67,12437,Wilson had to deal with governments and not with peoples; he was a
67,12438,man capable of tremendous flashes of vision and yet when put to
67,12439,"the test egotistical and limited, and the great wave of enthusiasm"
67,12440,he evoked passed and was wasted.
67,12441,
67,12442,"Says Dr. Dillon in his book, _The Peace Conference_: ""Europe, when"
67,12443,"the President touched its shores, was as clay ready for the"
67,12444,creative potter.  Never before were the nations so eager to follow
67,12445,a Moses who would take them to the long-promised land where wars
67,12446,are prohibited and blockades unknown.  And to their thinking he
67,12447,was just that great leader.  In France men bowed down before him
67,12448,with awe and affection.  Labour leaders in Paris told me that they
67,12449,"shed tears of joy in his presence, and that their comrades would"
67,12450,go through fire and water to help him to realize his noble
67,12451,schemes.  To the working classes in Italy his name was a heavenly
67,12452,clarion at the sound of which the earth would be renewed.  The
67,12453,Germans regarded him and his doctrine as their sheet-anchor of
67,12454,safety.  The fearless Herr Muehlon said: 'If President Wilson were
67,12455,"to address the Germans and pronounce a severe sentence upon them,"
67,12456,they would accept it with resignation and without a murmur and set
67,12457,to work at once.'  In German-Austria his fame was that of a
67,12458,"saviour, and the mere mention of his name brought balm to the"
67,12459,"suffering and surcease of sorrow to the afflicted ... ."""
67,12460,
67,12461,Such were the overpowering expectations that President Wilson
67,12462,raised.  How completely he disappointed them and how weak and
67,12463,futile was the League of Nations he made is too long and too
67,12464,distressful a story to tell here.  He exaggerated in his person
67,12465,"our common human tragedy, he was so very great in his dreams and"
67,12466,so incapable in his performance.  America dissented from the acts
67,12467,of its President and would not join the League Europe accepted
67,12468,from him.  There was a slow realization on the part of the
67,12469,American {425} people that it had been rushed into something for
67,12470,which it was totally unprepared.  There was a corresponding
67,12471,realization on the part of Europe that America had nothing ready
67,12472,to give to the old world in its extremity.  Born prematurely and
67,12473,"crippled at its birth, that League has become indeed, with its"
67,12474,elaborate and unpractical constitution and its manifest
67,12475,"limitations of power, a serious obstacle in the way of any"
67,12476,effective reorganization of international relationships.  The
67,12477,problem would be a clearer one if the League did not yet exist.
67,12478,Yet that world-wide blaze of enthusiasm that first welcomed the
67,12479,"project, that readiness of men everywhere round and about the"
67,12480,"earth, of men, that is, as distinguished from governments, for a"
67,12481,"world control of war, is a thing to be recorded with emphasis in"
67,12482,any history.  Behind the short-sighted governments that divide and
67,12483,"mismanage human affairs, a real force for world unity and world"
67,12484,order exists and grows.
67,12485,
67,12486,From 1918 onward the world entered upon an age of conferences.  Of
67,12487,these the Conference at Washington called by President Harding
67,12488,"(1921) has been the most successful and suggestive.  Notable, too,"
67,12489,is the Genoa Conference (1922) for the appearance of German and
67,12490,Russian delegates at its deliberations.  We will not discuss this
67,12491,long procession of conferences and tentatives in any detail.  It
67,12492,becomes more and more clearly manifest that a huge work of
67,12493,reconstruction has to be done by mankind if a crescendo of such
67,12494,convulsions and world massacres as that of the great war is to be
67,12495,"averted.  No such hasty improvisation as the League of Nations, no"
67,12496,patched-up system of Conferences between this group of states and
67,12497,"that, which change nothing with an air of settling everything,"
67,12498,will meet the complex political needs of the new age that lies
67,12499,before us.  A systematic development and a systematic application
67,12500,"of the sciences of human relationship, of personal and group"
67,12501,"psychology, of financial and economic science and of education,"
67,12502,"sciences still only in their infancy, is required.  Narrow and"
67,12503,"obsolete, dead and dying moral and political ideas have to be"
67,12504,replaced by a clearer and a simpler conception of the common
67,12505,origins and destinies of our kind.
67,12506,
67,12507,[Illustration: A PEACEFUL GARDEN IN ENGLAND]
67,12508,
67,12509,"But if the dangers, confusions and disasters that crowd upon man"
67,12510,"in these days are enormous beyond any experience of the past, it"
67,12511,is because science has brought him such powers as he never had
67,12512,"{426} before.  And the scientific method of fearless thought,"
67,12513,"exhaustively lucid statement, and exhaustively criticized"
67,12514,"planning, which has given him these as yet uncontrollable powers,"
67,12515,gives him also the hope of controlling these powers.  Man is still
67,12516,only adolescent.  His troubles are not the troubles of senility
67,12517,and exhaustion but of increasing and still undisciplined strength.
67,12518,"When we look at all {427} history as one process, as we have been"
67,12519,"doing in this book, when we see the steadfast upward struggle of"
67,12520,"life towards vision and control, then we see in their true"
67,12521,proportions the hopes and dangers of the present time.  As yet we
67,12522,are hardly in the earliest dawn of human greatness.  But in the
67,12523,"beauty of flower and sunset, in the happy and perfect movement of"
67,12524,young animals and in the delight of ten thousand various
67,12525,"landscapes, we have some intimations of what life can do for us,"
67,12526,"and in some few works of plastic and pictorial art, in some great"
67,12527,"music, in a few noble buildings and happy gardens, we have an"
67,12528,intimation of what the human will can do with material
67,12529,possibilities.  We have dreams; we have at present undisciplined
67,12530,but ever increasing power.  Can we doubt that presently our race
67,12531,"will more than realize our boldest imaginations, that it will"
67,12532,"achieve unity and peace, that it will live, the children of our"
67,12533,"blood and lives will live, in a world made more splendid and"
67,12534,"lovely than any palace or garden that we know, going on from"
67,12535,strength to strength in an ever widening circle of adventure and
67,12536,"achievement?  What man has done, the little triumphs of his"
67,12537,"present state, and all this history we have told, form but the"
67,12538,prelude to the things that man has got to do.
