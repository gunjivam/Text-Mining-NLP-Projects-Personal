AustinChronicle,78," There are so many incredible aspects to Last Christmas, it’s difficult to figure out where to begin. It’s akin to an unexpected present received from a friend on that titular day, a surprising tonic to a genre that delights in making the holidays either celebratory or morose (or both, usually). Let’s begin with the inspiration, which you will only be unfamiliar with if you haven’t ever gone shopping during the Christmas season (highly unlikely). A seasonal perennial, Wham!’s beloved and eponymous song has inspired a film that was co-written by Emma Thompson (along with Bryony Kimmings). Thompson had actually been working on the story prior to George Michael’s death in 2016 and got his blessing to adapt it. Believe me, it gets much more interesting from there.

So, to begin: Daenerys Stormborn, er, Emilia Clarke, is a Croatian émigré named Kate who is trying to eke out a life in London, basically living out of the carry-on bag she carts around everywhere and working in one of those year-round Christmas stores, run by Santa (Yeoh, slightly one-note, but it’s the note she does well), that cater to a clientele enamored of that holiday. Kate meets-cute with Tom (Golding), a too-good-to-be-true guy who rides around the city on a bicycle and volunteers at homeless shelters, which is a subplot that while bringing in that holiday ethos of giving, is somewhat problematic in that, guess what? All the homeless people are happy for some reason. Add to that forays into the life of Kate’s sister Marta (Leonard), a successful lawyer whose relationship with another woman is being kept a secret from her mother, Petra (Thompson, clearly having fun with her accent), and their father, who is driving a minicab for money, and you have this weird convergence of holiday cheer and social commentary.

But you know what? It works. Director Paul Feig is not unfamiliar with traversing these waters of a slap and a tickle. He’ll give you the Christmas cheer and also the realities of life, and it’s helpful that Thompson and Kimmings have razor-sharp instincts when it comes to that short, sharp, shocked brand of British humor that we all love so well. And Clarke, as Kate, is luminous in the role. Of course, if you are familiar with the song, you know that someone gives their heart away, but the very next day, they give it away. The literal aspects of that song I will not spoil, but it’s fascinating that Clarke herself had to undergo multiple surgeries for a brain aneurysm after filming the first season of Game of Thrones, which makes the film all the more intriguing. A spiritual successor to Love, Actually (which is probably why it got the green light in the first place) Last Christmas is the Fight Club of holiday movies with George Michael looking from the beyond, and I couldn’t be happier. "
ChicagoSunTimes,88,"Christmas comes early this year with “Last Christmas”!

This holiday season, give yourself the present of “Last Christmas”!

“Last Christmas” is one of the best Christmas movies in years!

Sorry (not sorry) for getting all corny and blurb-y with my enthusiasm for “Last Christmas,” a sweet and magical and unabashedly heart-tugging holiday love story with echoes of everything from “Love, Actually” to “The Shop Around the Corner” to “It’s a Wonderful Life.”

Universal Pictures presents a film directed by Paul Feig and written by Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings. Rated PG-13 (for language and sexual content). Running time: 103 minutes. Opens Thursday at local theaters.

The versatile and prolific director Paul Feig (“Bridesmaids,” “The Heat,” “A Simple Favor”) shelves his darker comedy instincts for a funny-with-a-heart tone and look, and it makes for a winning formula, even when you have to resist the urge to roll your eyes at some of the pretty shameless grabs for laughs and/or tears. (I mean, there’s a montage of colorful and in some cases quite talented homeless folks auditioning for a Christmas musical, for crying out loud.)

“Last Christmas” also benefits greatly from a sparkling screenplay co-written by Emma Thompson (who also turns in a terrific supporting performance), and the effortlessly charming and altogether camera-friendly Emilia Clarke (“Game of Thrones”) and Henry Golding (“Crazy Rich Asians”) in the leads.

You watch these two lovelies walking the shiny, snow-dappled, beautifully lit, cozy and cinema-stylized neighborhood streets of London, lost in each other’s gaze to the point where it’s as if they don’t even see anyone else, and you feel as if you’ve landed in Romantic Comedy/Drama Heaven — with a LOT of music from the late great George Michael, from the song that gives the movie its title to the perfectly timed placement of songs such as “Freedom,” “Faith,” “Heal the Pain,” “One More Try,” “Move On” and “Praying for Time.”

The songs are often spot-on accompaniment for the ups and downs of Clarke’s Katerina, a 26-year-old aspiring singer who survived a near-fatal illness but is now drowning in a self-created tsunami of binge-drinking, one-night stands, self-pity and boorish behavior that has left her estranged from her sister, in danger of losing her day job, and persona non grata with nearly all of her friends. (When Katerina crashes at your flat, she has a troubling habit of breaking things and in one case accidentally murdering an exotic fish.)

Freedom. Faith. Heal the Pain. Move On. The very titles of these songs are pitch-perfect for this story.

Clarke works those expressive eyebrows for everything she’s got and practically blinds us with her killer smile, but she’s also effective at conveying Katerina’s depression and self-loathing. Kate can be annoying as hell, but we’re rooting for her throughout and we welcome her efforts, one step at a time, to become a better person.

Much of Katerina’s brightened outlook on life comes about after she meets and becomes friends and possibly more with Golding’s Tom Webster, a dashing and infectiously upbeat and quite mysterious stranger who has a penchant of breaking into brief dances as if he’s hearing a Gene Kelly musical in his head.

Tom keeps showing Katerina little pockets and pieces of London she’s never even noticed. He’s constantly reminding her to literally “look up” and soak in the world all its glory. And he’s such a do-gooder you wonder if this guy is too good to be true.

Not that the Katerina/Tom arc is necessarily the most compelling part of “Last Christmas.” It’s a major element, but this movie isn’t THEIR story; it’s primarily Katerina’s story.

Emma Thompson is pure gold as Katerina’s doomsday-outlook, ever-fretting mother Petra, who along with her husband Ivan (Boris Isakovic) and their two daughters (Kate and Lydia Leonard’s Marta) fled the former Yugoslavia and have made England their home — although Petra has never totally left the old country behind. (When it’s suggested Petra get out of the house and keep busy and see friends, she deadpans, “My friends were all killed.”)

Then there’s the regal Michelle Yeoh, who nails a comedic role as Katerina’s boss, who calls herself “Santa” because after all she runs a year-round Christmas store filled with wall-to-wall kitsch. (When Katerina expresses surprise upon learning the Chinese-born Santa’s real name isn’t actually Santa, her boss hilariously explains the various names she’s used in previous jobs.)

The screenplay allows director Feig to sprinkle in some social commentary and even a Brexit moment without hammering us over the head with the messaging. It’s just another instance of “Last Christmas” rising above the standard, lightweight romantic comedy holiday fare and serving up a more substantial and resonant story.

Even on my most Ebenezer of days, I wouldn’t have been able to resist this sentimental journey. For all the great use of so many George Michael songs, the tune that might best describe “Last Christmas” is “Put a Little Love in Your Heart.”"
HollywoodReporter,50,"It's at the point when two mutually infatuated strangers break into an empty skating rink, gliding gracefully around while the rink's sound system magically plays something appropriate, that a movie lover of a certain age and background might realize that Paul Feig's Last Christmas isn't a strangely off-target Yuletide romance: It's a gender-flipped remake of 1980's Olivia Newton-John vehicle Xanadu.

Emilia Clarke plays the troubled artist who has lost touch with her own gifts; Henry Golding is the mysterious, inspirational dreamboat who, instead of giving our heroine his phone number, simply shows up whenever he's most needed; and the late George Michael, unable to compose a suite of new pop songs as Electric Light Orchestra did, has provided an entire back catalog for the filmmakers to choose from.

The similarities may or may not end there. Last Christmas is not as radiantly, lovably bad as Xanadu, though there may be some impressionable young viewers (especially those with serious crushes on Clarke and/or Golding) who will remember it fondly four decades from now. It's a misfire by just about any measure, but it earns some warm feelings for its determination not to be like anything else currently in circulation. Sure, it concludes with the obligatory British rom-com singalong; but that's the most ordinary thing in this peculiar, heartfelt romance about learning to move past trauma and finding meaning in helping others.

Opening credits inform us that Last Christmas, written by Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings, is inspired by the Michael holiday classic of the same name. Linger on that tidbit at your peril: Midway through the film, as you're still wondering what doomed romance Clarke's Kate is supposed to be getting over here (there isn't one), you may suddenly understand the bad-pun liberties the script has taken with Michael's lovesick lyrics; and if you do, you'll likely guess things the pic doesn't yet want you to know. Consider taking things at face value — or looking for more Xanadu parallels — instead.

Kate is a between-apartments Londoner who has burned nearly every bridge in her life — careless with others' trust, she's couch surfing with the few remaining friends who'll put her up while going on auditions for singing gigs she's not prepared to get. She works in a year-round Christmas store, wearing an elf costume and hawking tacky ornaments for the boss (Michelle Yeoh) she knows only as ""Santa.""

To her horror, she may soon have to move back in with her family, finally answering the countless messages left by her suffocating mother Petra (Thompson). Petra is an immigrant who fled Yugoslav wars around 1999, and is still haunted by those memories. Her effect on her daughter is summed up by the ringtone the latter has assigned to her phone calls: Fine Young Cannibals' 1989 hit ""She Drives Me Crazy.""

One day at work, Kate notices a handsome man standing in front of the shop. She goes out to meet Golding's Tom, who's staring up at a rare bird on a ledge. Quickly put off by his ostentatious sense of wonder, she shoots him down when he asks her to go for a walk: ""I'm busy, you're weird, bye.""

But Tom keeps showing up, swinging by on his bike until she goes wandering with him. Behavior Feig and Golding seemingly intend to be charming may come off to some viewers as weirdly condescending: Tom keeps insisting that Kate ""look up"" to see the things she walks by every day — a mildly amusing bit of street art, say, or the narrowest alley in London. (Clearly, the city's tourist bureau had no input into the script.) He chides her about the lousy food she eats, tells her she should ditch her distracting phone as he has, and twirls around when she might rather have him stare meaningfully into her eyes. He doesn't tell her to smile more, but he might as well.

Now and then, he ghosts her, forcing her to hunt for him at the homeless shelter where he volunteers. (Well, of course he feeds the hungry when he's not making people feel guilty about under-appreciating their hometown.)

Kate does wind up, after some especially careless drunken misbehavior, having to move back home. Mom isn't nearly as bad as everyone makes her out to be, but she is something of a one-note downer, fond of breaking into dirge-like folk songs from the old country and worrying that Brexit signals a return to hard times. (The script takes a couple of opportunities to show sympathy for the targets of anti-immigrant anger.) The high-energy domestic angst will amuse some viewers, but it's a distraction from the more credibly screwed-up aspects of Clarke's performance: Kate's a wreck for her own reasons, and even when the character is feigning obliviousness about the havoc she wreaks, the actress takes her lost-ness seriously.

Kate is puzzled by Tom's take-it-slow approach to their budding romance, and is perhaps sublimating some desires when she starts volunteering at the shelter when he's not around — busking in her elf costume to raise money for the charity's Christmas pageant. At least she has Michael's songs to comfort her. Though it pegs her as a fan in opening scenes, the movie does little to explain the ubiquity of his music here; given how well the songs suit most (if not all) of the places they're used, perhaps there's no need to explain. The Hugh Grant/Drew Barrymore film Music and Lyrics is more interesting for viewers fascinated with the phenomenon of Michael's pop stardom (even if it creates a fictional stand-in for the singer), but Last Christmas does justice to many of the songs themselves, and not in an overbearing, Mamma Mia! kind of way.

Little can be said about the final act without stealing the film's thunder. But a viewer who hasn't been put off by one thing or another in the pic's first hour may well go along with its last left turn. Those who do will be rewarded with Clarke's vaguely Amy Winehouse-ish rendition of the title track — horn section, elf costume and all."
MovieNation,38,"Here it is, that “lost” chapter of “Love, Actually” that we’ve been rummaging through the vaults for. “Last Christmas,” they’re calling it. “Dull, Actually” is more accurate.

It’s a mopey holiday romance leaning heavily on the “Game of Thrones” charms of Emilia Clarke and the music of George Michael.

And if you’re not ready to question her ability to play comedy and second guess the value the world puts on the George Michael songbook by the time this has burned through 102 minutes you’ll never get back, you never will be.

Clarke tries to sparkle every line the Emma Thompson/Bryony Kimmings screenplay gives her. She laughs. A lot. But she’s the only one guffawing and showing a lot of teeth as she does, because there’s virtually nothing here that will tickle anybody else.

Clarke stars as Kate, “Katerina” to her Croatian family. She’s 30ish, has just moved out of her parents’ duplex and is schlepping her suitcase all over London Towne, still wearing her costume for work. She’s unintentionally made a career out of being an elf-clerk at Yuletide Wonderful, owned by the Chinese emigre who goes by the name “Santa” (Michelle Yeoh).

“Time to sparkle,” Santa growls.

It’s a tacky yet quirky shop, and it doesn’t pay enough to let Kate set up housekeeping on her own. So she imposes on one friend after another, thoughtlessly and clumsily breaking this and sullying that, and picking up guys in bars that she brings “home” for a little pre-Christmas coitus.

We’ve seen her as a child, warbling a George Michael song with her choir back in pre-breakup Yugoslavia. That’s her goal — singing on the London stage. The auditions she tumbles into suggest how unlikely that dream is — pleasant (ish) but untrained voice, pathologically tardy, self-absorbed. Maybe delusional.

Hell, she should try New York.

Santa seethes at Kate’s carelessness on the job. Her thick-accented mother (Emma Thompson) leaves her voice mails by metric tonne. And losing one more set of friends by being the roommate from Hell might be her wakeup call.

Ours? Well, we’re going to stick around to see how she ever made friends in the first place.

Then the tall handsome stranger, Tom, strolls into her life. Henry Golding of “Crazy Rich Asians” plays this patient, eccentric and very-interested-in-Kate Londoner. He’s obsessed with getting her to take a walk with him. She chuckles how much he’s “not my type” and how the places he wants to walk have a “serial killery” vibe.

But he’s always looking up. And as she looks up with him, she notices the glories of London in all its holiday splendor, and its quirky architectural history. He shows her his secret garden. And even though she’s still doing the barfly-hookup thing after they meet, she continues to take walks with Tom — appreciating the beauty, checking in at the homeless shelter where he volunteers.

“Might as well have ‘SAINT’ tattooed on your forehead!”

She takes an interest in the only way she knows how. She comes on to him. Tom brushes that off in a “we just met” way, and the walks continue.

Kate, of course, has a secret. She’s been sick, we’re told. She meets her doctor with her mum and gets read the riot act over her unhealthy lifestyle.

Tom has his own secrets. And if you sit there pondering, as I did, “WHY are they together?” well, you’ll figure both secrets out before the first one is revealed.

Golding has an effortless charm here that we haven’t seen in his other performances. But his inability to spark chemistry with any leading lady is an ongoing issue, and that makes the gears grind in this syrupy Paul Feig (“Bridesmaids,” “Ghostbusters”) confection. It’s why we sit and wonder why these two are “together,” because the script and performances don’t make their connection organic or believable.

Clarke’s character arc is that she develops compassion being around Tom, starts helping with the shelter, going easier on her mom, matchmaking for her lonely boss. She’s not awful as Kate, but the strain shows. At least her green eyes match her elf costume, damn near perfectly.

But like a lot of Feig’s recent work, it’s the “woke” elements of “Last Christmas” that seem to get more attention than the BASIC dramatic/romantic/comic/sentimental stuff. Anti-immigrant bigotry (a subtext in a couple of movies this holiday season, “Knives Out,” for instance), the ugly underpinnings of Brexit, and a gay couple just needing family acceptance, all are here and designed to deliver the warm fuzzies.

So is the heavy reliance on the George Michael Songbook. Repeating his “Last Christmas” title tune ad nauseum does him no favors, and removing his performance from many of the songs emphasizes his inadequacies as a lyricist — with that song, in particular, standing out as insipid. And the ultimate spoiler.

After a while, though, we get ahead of the editors, recognizing “Oh, this’d be the PERFECT place to use ‘Faith,'” etc. Kate, of course, dozes off and we ALL know what song will awaken her before she go goes.

The banter is, first scene to last, awful. Delivering bad dialogue at top speed doesn’t make it better, Ms. Clarke. Why does she keep saying she’s from “The Former Yugoslavia?” NO emigre would refer to her homeland that way. Her mother doesn’t.

Yeoh looks perplexed enough to mutter “This is supposed to be FUN?” between takes.

Still, there’s one great thing Tom and “Last Christmas” have to teach us. Kate wants to give him her digits. “Where’s your phone?”

He locked it in a cubbard, he says. And once he did, he stopped looking down and started looking up at the city. A lovely sentiment. Not the only one in the film, mind you. But the only one that stuck with me from this instantly forgotten treacle."
NewYorkPost,25,"It’s a shame that George Michael’s final major artistic contribution to the world is the crummy movie “Last Christmas.” In its shoddy attempt to make a splash in the British romantic-comedy genre, it amounts to nothing more than a careless whisper.

A dragon-less Emilia Clarke plays Kate, a hard-living 26-year-old in London, who loves Michael’s music and uses one-night stands to secure a bed for the evening. As she’s kicked to the curb by one hookup’s peeved girlfriend, Kate yells, “Why is my life so s–t?!”

Perhaps it’s because she works for a Christmas kitsch shop in Covent Garden during the day and unsuccessfully auditions for West End shows at night. Does she have a passion for theater, or did she go to acting school? Unclear. A swarm of moths have made a meal of Emma Thompson’s script.

Just as her friends start giving up on this hot mess, Kate meets Tom (Henry Golding, cardboard) outside her shop and begins a flirtation. The sweet guy wears a khaki coat and gray shirt, always, and is on a bike, always. He doesn’t have a cellphone and disappears for days on end. None of this strikes her as weird, and they go on a series of spontaneous walks through narrow alleyways.

Although the actors have no chemistry, Kate’s life begins to change for the better. She starts helping the homeless and reconnects with her family of Yugoslav immigrants, including her mother Petra (Thompson). Her ilk becomes the writer’s way of shoehorning in a Brexit subplot in which immigrants are living in fear of their futures in the UK. “They hate us! They send us all back!” screams Petra, who came to England in 1999. This is a bit rich coming from Thompson, who is about as Yugoslav as a taco.

Clarke is appealing in that it’s nice to see her make actual facial expressions and have a personality. She does not, however, set fire to the screen as Daenerys did to King’s Landing. The supporting characters, including Michelle Yeoh as her boss and Thompson’s Petra, are unbelievable and overblown.

“Last Christmas” isn’t particularly funny, or romantic. And the film’s twist ending, which many viewers accurately guessed after watching the trailer, is idiotic and poorly explained. Let’s just say the movie takes Michael’s “Last Christmas” lyrics a tad too literally."
ReelViews,75,"If Richard Curtis watches Last Christmas, he will likely do so with a smile on his face. In approach, tone, and intent, this is very much like the kind of film Curtis makes and bears more than a passing resemblance to his unlikely now-classic holiday season offering, Love Actually. (Has it really been 16 years since that movie debuted?) Writer/actress Emma Thompson was a member of Curtis’ Love Actually ensemble and has infused Last Christmas’ DNA with some of the same crowd-pleasing elements. With Paul Feig in the director’s chair, this unapologetically sentimental film provides viewers with opportunities to laugh and cry while morphing into something a little different than what the trailers and marketing material suggest.

This is not a rom-com. Or at least, it’s not just a rom-com. Certainly, there’s more than a passing whiff of romance in the air between photogenic stars Emilia Clarke (looking nothing like her Game of Thrones character) and Henry Golding (looking exactly like his Crazy Rich Asians character). Last Christmas, with a passing nod to Charles Dickens, is about the Christmastime redemption of Clarke’s Kate – how circumstances change her from a cynical, anti-Christmas shrew into a softer, gentler, more caring of herself. No Taming necessary. Golding is along for the ride as Tom, the most patient man in the world, who (following a meet-cute involving a pooping bird) has a knack of appearing when Kate most needs to see him and offers long walks and sage advice to “look up.” He also resolutely refuses to sleep with her, although he’s not above engaging in an occasional kiss.

Last Christmas spends as much time with Kate’s family life as it does with her dalliances with Tom. When not imposing on the hospitality of friends and lovers, Kate lives at home with her mother, Petra (Thompson), and father, Ivan (Boris Isakovic). Her sister, Marta (Lydia Leonard), has her own place but occasionally visits. Kate’s family immigrated to England from the former Yugoslavia to escape the war, but she was so young at the time that London is the only home she knows. A life-threatening condition that nearly killed Kate has made her already high-strung mother hypervigilant, creating friction between mother and daughter. Kate and Marta are constantly at each other’s throats and barely on speaking terms.

As a girl, Kate was a promising singer but, in part because of her illness, she never fulfilled her potential. Now she works as an elf at a Christmas Emporium run by the tyrannical “Santa” (Michelle Yeoh). Kate hates her life, hates her job, and engages in self-destructive behavior in between attending auditions at which she routinely fails. She’s a huge George Michael fan (the movie is set in late 2017, a year after he died), which gives the filmmakers a thin excuse for peppering the soundtrack with various songs from Michael’s WHAM! days and solo career.

Last Christmas joins a new trend in adult-oriented motion pictures that relies on the output of one artist or group in crafting a soundtrack: Queen for Bohemian Rhapsody, Elton John for Rocket Man, The Beatles for Yesterday, Bruce Springsteen for Blinded by the Light, and Michael for Last Christmas. Of those titles, Last Christmas has the weakest connection. Although the film’s title is derived from the popular WHAM! holiday track (and is featured in at least three different iterations, one of which is the recorded version), the other songs (all of which are excerpted rather than played in full) are randomly scattered throughout. There are also some curious omissions – while “Faith,” “Everything She Wants,” and “Freedom 1990” make appearances, “Careless Whisper” and “Father Figure” are among the missing.

In recent years, there have been few throwback Christmas-themed theatrical releases, with movie studios ceding the territory to cable and streaming networks. As a result, Last Christmas feels almost nostalgic despite its modern sensibilities. The movie is sentimental and manipulative – those things go with the territory – but not overly so. Thompson and Feig give the production an edge and apply a twist (one that is predictable early on but works nonetheless). The dialogue is sharp, there’s a none-too-subtle message aimed at anti-immigration policies, and Emilia Clarke gives a warm, delightful performance. Last Christmas may have trouble finding its box office footing with so many higher-profile films fighting for an audience but this is one of the most enjoyable non-prestige offerings out there and, if it doesn’t find its niche in theaters, it will certainly surface again in the home video market and become a favorite for Christmases to come."
RollingStone,20,"Kate (Emilia Clarke) is in a rut. Long ago, as a girl growing up in Yugoslavia circa 1999, she was a songbird who could turn George Michael’s “Heal the Pain” into a transcendental choral experience. Decades later, she’s a young woman who drinks away her pain in London’s pubs and manages to alienate her most loyal friends. Don’t get her started about her family: Dad (Boris Isakovic) was a former lawyer who now drives a cab; Mom (co-writer Emma Thompson) browbeats everyone; her sister (Lydia Leonard) isn’t speaking to her. Occasionally, she auditions for roles in musical theater productions like an ice-skating version of Frozen. Mostly, Kate half-heartedly works at a year-round Christmas decorations store. She is a lovable, quirky fuck-up, U.K. Toxic-Twee division.

But soft, what light through yonder retail shop’s window breaks? His name is Tom (Crazy Rich Asians’ Henry Golding). He’s so very handsome but also so very annoying, Kate thinks, what with his constant bike-riding and unimpeachable optimism and endless requests that she “look up.” Because that’s how you see the wonders of the everyday world that are above you and all around you, if only you took the time to notice them! Kate mocks his sunny disposition. Tom forces her to be nicer to people, and to herself. Except the manic J. Crew dream hunk has a habit of taking off at inopportune moments — the guy “works nights,” you see — or disappearing altogether, and then mysteriously reappearing when our heroine is at her lowest. But in the meantime, she starts volunteering at the local homeless shelter, and acts as a matchmaker for her boss (Michelle Yeoh) and a distinguished Dutch customer (Peter Mygind) who the older woman likes and calls “Boy,” which … just … never mind.

Even if you haven’t paid attention to the slight internet chatter around Last Christmas, you can sense some sort of big reveal is looming on the horizon. In fact, you can probably identify exactly what said climactic curveball is if you’re paying a smidgen of attention, especially when talk of some vague past illness Kate has suffered begins to surface. When your worst fears are confirmed — and then doubled down on — it doesn’t cause your heart to go pitter-patter so much as make your blood boil with rage. The are-you-serious turn that the film treats as deep is admittedly on-brand, however. This is the kind of movie that also mistakes obvious and cloying for clever, ham-fisted for subtle, and merely stringing together George Michael tunes as some sort of homage.

Right, the Michael factor: The title takes its name from Wham’s melancholy 1986 ditty, which took on a new level of poignancy when the singer passed away on December 25th, 2016. (Remember this date.) After Thompson was approached with an offer to pen a script based on the song, the British screen icon, her collaborator/husband Greg Wise and her cowriter Bryony Kimmings instead conceived a Christmas movie that borrowed heavily from his music. And while the end result never goes full Mamma Mia with the idea, it does mean that, for example, a scene of Kate waking up will be accompanied by a video of Wham’s “Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.” When she sings a lullaby to heal her pain, it turns into “Heal the Pain” on the soundtrack. A montage of the couple experiencing a rush of blissful freedom is set to the strains of “Freedom ’90.” The fact that Kate’s increasingly smitten glances at this enigmatic beau do not cue up “I Want Your Sex” feels like a missed opportunity, but if you’re like us, you will feel a nostalgic pang upon hearing Michael’s songs again. Cherish that feeling of good will. It is in very short supply here.

Which brings us to the genuine spoiler here: Last Christmas is bad. Incredibly, shockingly, monumentally bad. The kind of bad that falls somewhere between finding a lump of coal in your stocking and discovering one painfully lodged in your rectum. The kind of bad that you get when you bring together people of enormous talent and then are forced to watch them flail around, lost and flop-sweat desperate, attempting to make a romantic comedy that is mind-bogglingly short of both elements. The kind of bad where you might literally hear the tolerance messaging — same-sex unions, homelessness, anti-immigrant prejudice, Brexit — being ticked off a checklist were it not drowned out by the sound of everyone patting themselves on the back. The kind of bad that you get when you aim for that Richard Curtis sweet-spot à la Love Actually and actually land, face-first, into a pile of garbage just like your lead character. Yes, Clarke’s Kate is a mess. She can’t begin to compete with the movie she is in. You pray for a trio of dragons to swoop from the sky and burn the whole thing to the ground, incinerating prints of the film as an added bonus. (We’re kidding, of course. Films are no longer shown in multiplexes via prints.)

How this managed to devolve into such a tainted-tinsel disaster is, frankly, a more intriguing mystery than the one at the center of the story. Clarke has all the makings of a screwball comedian. Golding has screen presence and charisma to burn. On paper, the notion of Thompson telling dick jokes in a thick Eastern European accent sounds hilarious; we’re also talking about the woman who wrote the screenplay for Sense and Sensibility, the gold standard for how to do modern lit-classic adaptations correctly. Paul Feig directed Bridesmaids, Spy and numerous key episodes of NBC’s The Office. Even if you don’t dig the tune that gives the movie its name, George Michael’s back catalogue is emotionally resonant and eminently ripe for the full-soundtrack treatment. Who couldn’t use a story doused in the milk of human kindness?

Individually, the ingredients seem foolproof. Add it all together, paced like a slowly leaking faucet and cut together in a way that makes you wonder whether the editors were being chased by the police, and what you get is a flavorless mishmash. It makes sense that Last Christmas isn’t coming out at the end of December but right on the cusp of Thanksgiving. It’s a bona fide holiday-movie turkey."
Slant,38,"Multiple times in Last Christmas, Kate and her immigrant parents (Emma Thompson and Boris Isakovic) say that they hail from the “former Yugoslavia,” a rather outdated and strangely non-specific way of referring to their origins. When Kate comforts an Eastern European couple on the bus after they’re accosted by a Brexiter, they excitedly but vaguely ask her, “You’re from our country?” At this point, Last Christmas has begun to sound downright evasive, and you may wonder if the filmmakers even know where Kate’s family is supposed to come from. To screenwriters Bryony Kimmings and Emma Thompson, such details would appear to be extraneous to this anti-Brexit Christmas Carol. Merely tacking an affirmation of immigrant rights onto a familiar Christmas narrative about selflessness requires little more than an evocation of a general Slavic-ness about the characters.

Another element that Paul Feig’s film keeps pointedly indistinct is the nature of a recent illness that the twentysomething Kate (Emilia Clarke) has endured. Clearly depressed in the wake of a major health event, the aspiring singer is ostentatiously selfish, exploiting what remains of her friends’ and her boss’s good will. Currently homeless, she travels with a roller suitcase from crash pad to crash pad, drinking heavily, bringing home one-night stands, and openly flirting with customers at work. Kate is employed full time at a Christmas shop in London whose wisecracking owner (Michelle Yeoh) goes by the name Santa. At one point, Santa expresses distress at Kate’s haggard, disheveled state because she doesn’t want the young woman to drop dead. “I don’t have enough tinsel to cover your body,” she worries.

The grounds for Santa’s concern that a woman in her mid-20s may be killed by the lifestyle lived by many Londoners in their mid-20s is left open because its ultimate reveal three-quarters of the way through the film points toward one of the silliest twist endings in recent memory. We only learn what happened to Kate when she reveals the scar from an operation to Tom (Henry Golding), the beautiful, saintly man she begins seeing after finding him bird-watching outside the Christmas shop. Suffice it to say, Last Christmas is “inspired by” the Wham! song of the same name, specifically one line—and one line only—from its chorus.

Kate loves George Michael—one imagines she feels a bond with the late singer, the son of a Balkan immigrant himself, though the filmmakers leave this unexplored—and thus Last Christmas attempts to remake some of his most well-known songs into seasonally appropriate tunes. Obligatory montages to “Faith” and “Freedom” speed us through parts of Kate’s Tom-facilitated rehabilitation from cynical wastrel to Christmas-spirited patron of the homeless, though these segments are brief, cutting off the songs before we realize they have absolutely nothing to do with the jolly Christmas vibes that the film attempts to give off. Even “Last Christmas” is only heard in snippets, lest we realize that the song’s lyrics have little to do with seasonal giving and charity, and everything to do with regret, hurt, and resentment.

Last Christmas counts on our absorbing the sugary sound of Michael’s music but none of its substance. This is perhaps the film’s fatal flaw, and it’s not unrelated to its evasiveness regarding Kate’s origins and its simplistic affirmation of liberal outrage at Brexit. There’s a lack of concreteness about the story and characters—true from the beginning, but particularly after its last-act reveal—that render its reiteration of Christmas lessons utterly toothless.

Besides the general sound of Michael’s music, Last Christmas clearly draws influence from classic Christmas-themed films like It’s a Wonderful Life and The Shop Around the Corner. Such films, though, earned their Christmas miracles and holiday moralizing by grounding their stories in a sense of the community created by bonds between fully realized characters. Clarke works hard to make the messy, perpetually flustered Kate relatable, but the film surrounds the character with a community as kitschy and false as the trinkets she sells in Santa’s shop."
TheFilmStage,75,"It’s nice to have a Christmas movie in theaters. It’s also nice to watch two lead performers get to know each other on screen, and appear to genuinely enjoy each other’s company. With Last Christmas, directed by Paul Feig, viewers get two-for-one. Starring Emilia Clarke as Kate and Henry Golding as the mysterious do-gooder who has captured her eye, there exists a light-hearted energy throughout that is seasoned with a bit of complexity. Considering the film is co-written by Emma Thompson (from a story by her and husband Greg Wise), this is no surprise.

Kate works as an “Elf” at a Christmas shop in London, her tough-but-fair boss taking on the brand-conscious name “Santa” (Michelle Yeoh, having a lot of fun) and constantly criticizing her employee of being lazy. We learn that Kate was “really sick” a couple of years back and is still coping, whether she likes it or not. Her mother (Thompson) won’t stop worrying about her, her sister (Lydia Leonard) is tired of worrying about her and her father (Boris Isakovic) refuses to get out his cab at night to deal with his family, especially his wife.

Once Tom (Golding) comes into her life, things begin to take shape. Though largely perfunctory, his presence is surely welcome. Where the story goes from here one can probably guess, or at least get halfway there. Thompson and her co-writer Bryony Kimmings are breaking no new ground in the plot mechanics of Christmas movies, save the addition of some Brexit-fused social commentary. You see, Kate’s family emigrated from former Yugoslavia many years ago and her mother watches the television with a distinct fear of more-of-the-same in the U.K.

This influx of Thompson’s patented liberalism is welcome, though not overwhelming. The reason to watch is Clarke and Golding, who look more like movie stars than they ever have before. Most of their quippy banter works while selling the pre-packaged joy of the Christmas Spirit. All involved seem to acknowledge the inherent cynicism of a studio picture like this, though they never allow it to devolve into a negative experience.

There are legitimately affecting moments throughout, not to mention a real, near-deep exploration of depression and its effects on those in your life. It’s about as lovely to see Michelle Yeoh flirt as it is to see Emma Thompson perform at her most hammy. Clarke has been angling at legit leading lady status ever since she got called Khaleesi, to varying degrees of success. Last Christmas feels like the young actress is in full form. Forget the perceived genre limitations, this is a good performance. Her Kate is cutting, manipulative, charming, broken and funny. All at once! She’s fully human, a refreshing departure from some of her recent roles.

And while the Tom character may not get the same attention, that Henry Golding sure is something to look at. It may well be that Last Christmas‘s most memorable decision is shifting the oft-criticized Male Gaze over to Female. Let’s call it a Christmas miracle"
TimeOut,60,"Like a mug of eggnog dosed with a shot of gin, this mostly fizzy Christmas rom-com delivers its cozy message with a side order of cynicism.

If Bridget Jones’s Diary author Helen Fielding reworked A Christmas Carol, subbing in her heroine for Ebenezer Scrooge, it might look a little like this good-natured but lightweight rom-com about a struggling twentysomething finding salvation in a handsome stranger. If you can forgive an earnestly delivered but silly third-act twist that the film’s trailer telegraphed months ago, and some low-flame chemistry between Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, Last Christmas is a feel-nice addition to the seasonal canon. It’s purpose-built for anyone who’s watched The Holiday maybe six times too often.

Clarke plays Kate, a wannabe singer with a deep love for George Michael, humiliatingly forced to dress as an elf while working for the owner of a London Christmas shop (Michelle Yeoh). “I’m not a career elf,” she stresses, though given her wrecking-ball approach to life, you suspect she’d be sued for reputational damage by other elves if she were. Enter Golding’s mysterious stranger, Tom, a bike courier and a great listener who starts to reintroduce some hope to her life. But who is he? And why does he seem to have only one coat and (yikes) no phone?

Soundtracked by wall-to-wall Wham! and George Michael tunes (several versions of the title song feature, including a couple that amusingly emanate from ornamental decorations in the shop), their burgeoning romance takes in the sights of a picture-postcard city. Barring a notably somber middle-act dip, director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids) handles it all briskly. In the spirit of all good Christmas movies, it’s wildly untroubled by geography or realism (strangers talk to each other on an actual bus). And while the film makes a genuine attempt to engage with London’s homelessness problem—there’s a subplot based at a shelter—and nods toward the challenges of migrants, it’s done so in a superficial way that makes Richard Curtis look like Ken Loach.

The dialogue is a blunt instrument at times (“A shitting bird just shat in my eye,” grumbles Kate in a not-exactly-Nora-Ephron moment), but when the witticisms dry up, the charm of the cast mostly carries you along. Clarke is engaging as the sarcastic but not quite embittered Kate, a childhood immigrant from the former Yugoslavia. Emma Thompson (who co-wrote the screenplay with Bryony Kimmings) is a hoot as her heavily-accented alpha mom, who keeps memories of the old country alive by wailing folk songs at her daughter. Even Yeoh’s sternness takes on a new comic dimension when backdropped by a ton of Christmas kitsch.

If Last Christmas isn’t quite irresistible in its emotional moments and the cheesiest bits are borderline indigestible, its effervescence makes it a fun enough watch. At the very least, it’ll make you fall hard for its other romantic lead: London."
